## **1\. Transcription Regulation**

⑴ **Method 1.** DNA binding proteins

> ① Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids

>> ○ Non-specific interactions: Common in eukaryotic cells and archaea.

>> ○ Specific interactions

> ② **Structure 1.** Helix-turn-helix motif

>> ○ Recognition Helix: Interacts specifically with DNA.

>> ○ Turn: Composed of three amino acids, the first typically being glycine.

>> ○ Stabilizing helix: Stabilizes the recognition helix through hydrophobic interactions with the recognition helix.

> ③ **Structure 2.** Zinc finger

>> ○ Frequently found in eukaryotic regulatory proteins.

>> ○ Binds to zinc (Zn) ions.

>> ○ Recognition helix: Part of an alpha-helix. Binds to the DNA major groove.

>> ○ DNA-binding proteins contain at least two zinc fingers.

> ④ **Structure 3.** Leucine zipper

>> ○ Contains a region where a leucine residue appears every seven amino acids.

>> ○ Does not bind to DNA directly but binds to two recognition helices, influencing DNA orientation.

> ⑤ **Structure 4.** Helix-loop-helix motif

> ⑥ **Example 1.** Inducers and corepressors

> ⑦ **Example 2.** Lactose operon 

> ⑧ **Example 3.** Maltose metabolism in E. coli: Regulated by a regulon.

> ⑨ **Example 4.** The NrpR protein synthesized by Methanococcus maripaludis (methanogen) during nitrogen fixation is transcriptionally regulated.

> ⑩ **Example 5.** Pyrococcus furiosus (hyperthermophile) lacks a glucose transporter but carries out glycolysis, involving TrmBL1, which functions as both a repressor and activator.

⑵ **Method 2.** sRNA (Small RNA): 40 ~ 400 nucleotides

⑶ **Method 3.** Riboswitch

⑷ **Method 4.** Attenuation

> ① **Example 1.** Tryptophan Operon

## **2\. Signal Transduction**

⑴ **Method 1.** Two-component regulatory system: E. coli has approximately 50 two-component regulatory systems.

**Table 1.** Two-component regulatory systems in E. coli

<br>

> ① **Example 1.** Osmoregulation in E. coli: Involves OmpC, OmpF, OmpR, and EnvZ.

> ② **Example 2.** Chemotaxis: Involves MCP, CheA, CheW, CheY, and CheB.

> ③ **Example 3.** Regulation of flagellin rotation: Involves CheY and CheP.

> ④ **Example 4.** Quorum sensing: Detection of neighboring cell density

> ⑤ **Example 5.** Toxicity of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli: Involves AI-3.

> ⑥ **Example 6.** Toxicity of Staphylococcus aureus: Involves ArgA, ArgB, ArgC, and ArgD.

> ⑦ **Example 7.** Nutrient deprivation response in E. coli: Increased production of ppGpp inhibits cell division.

> ⑧ **Example 8.** Nutrient deprivation response in C. crescentus: Increased ppGpp production enhances motility.

> ⑨ **Example 9.** Response of M. tuberculosis to host immune reactions: Increased ppGpp production enhances persister cell formation.

> ⑩ **Example 10.** Global network

**Table 2.** Global network

<br>

> ⑪ **Example 11.** Two-component regulatory system in Streptomyces: Involves PhoR (membrane-bound histidine kinase sensor protein) and PhoP (cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator).

> ⑫ **Example 12.** Heat stress response in E. coli: Involves DnaK (≒ Hsp70), GroEL (≒ Hsp60), GroES (≒ Hsp10), and RpoH (σ32).

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Metabolic Regulation**

⑴ **Method 1.** Feedback inhibition

⑵ **Method 2.** Post-translational regulation

> ① **Example 1.** PPII signal transduction: Involves PII and GlnD.

> ② **Example 2.** Inactivation of sigma factors: Involves RpoE and RseA.
