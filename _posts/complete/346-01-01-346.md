**Figure 7.** Parallax Method 

<br>

> ① Discovered by German astronomer Bessel in 1838.

> ② 1 parsec (pc): Distance when parallax is 1 second of arc (").

> ③ Distance (pc) = 1 / Parallax (").

> ④ Additional

>> ○ If the angle is very small, θ ≒ tan θ ∝ 1 / distance.

>> ○ θ = 1 AU ÷ 1 pc = 1/3600 × π/180 (where 1 AU = 1.5 × 10^8 km)

>> ○ 1 pc = 3.09 × 10^16 m = **3.26 light-years**

 ⑵ Distance of distant stars

> ① Using Cepheid Variables, a type of intrinsic variable.

> ② **Step 1:** Measure the period.

> ③ **Step 2:** Measure brightness through the period-luminosity relationship.

> ④ **Step 3:** Determine absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude through the assumption that at 10 pc, absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude.

>> ○ **Assumption 1:** At a distance of 10 pc, absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude.

>> ○ **Assumption 2:** A 100-fold increase in brightness results in a decrease of 5 magnitudes.

>> ○ **Assumption 3:** A distance x-fold increase leads to a 2-fold decrease in brightness.

>> ○ Conclusion: When distance increases by 10 times, brightness decreases by 100 times, and apparent magnitude increases by 5.

>> ○ Main Conclusion: **Pogson's Formula**

>>> Observed magnitude (m) - Absolute magnitude (M) = 5 log(distance) - 5

>> ○ **Mnemonic Tip:** Distances formula

> ⑤ Using this, Hubble determined the distance of the Andromeda galaxy, resolving the Shapley-Curtis debate (1920) on extragalactic nature.

>> ○ Also known as spectral classification or color index.

>> ○ Sun's spectral type is G2V (V indicates luminosity).

> ② As color index increases, surface temperature decreases. O-type stars have the smallest color index.
