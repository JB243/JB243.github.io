>> ○ If the angle is very small, θ ≒ tan θ ∝ 1 / distance.

>> ○ θ = 1 AU ÷ 1 pc = 1/3600 × π/180 (where 1 AU = 1.5 × 10^8 km)

> ③ **Step 2:** Measure brightness through the period-luminosity relationship.

> ④ **Step 3:** Determine absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude through the assumption that at 10 pc, absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude.

>> ○ **Assumption 1:** At a distance of 10 pc, absolute magnitude equals apparent magnitude.

>> ○ **Assumption 2:** A 100-fold increase in brightness results in a decrease of 5 magnitudes.

>> ○ **Assumption 3:** A distance x-fold increase leads to a 2-fold decrease in brightness.

>> ○ Conclusion: When distance increases by 10 times, brightness decreases by 100 times, and apparent magnitude increases by 5.

>> ○ Main Conclusion **:** **Pogson's Formula**

>>> Observed magnitude (m) - Absolute magnitude (M) = 5 log(distance) - 5

>> ○ **Mnemonic Tip:** Distances formula
