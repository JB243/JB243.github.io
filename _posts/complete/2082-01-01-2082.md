## **1\. Group Theory**

⑴ Axiom

> ① **Closure**: ∀a, b ∈ G, a·b ∈ G

> ② **Associative Property**: ∀a, b, c ∈ G, (a·b)·c = a·(b·c)

> ③ **Identity Element**: For any a ∈ G, there exists e ∈ G such that a·e = e·a = a

> ④ **Inverse Element**: For any a ∈ G, there exists a<sup>-1</sup> such that a·a<sup>-1</sup> = a<sup>-1</sup>·a = e

>> ○ Uniqueness of Inverse: For any two inverses a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup>, a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>, a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup> = a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup> always holds

>> ○ a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup> = e·a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup> = (a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>·a)·a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup> = a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>·(a·a<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup>) = a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>·e = a<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>

⑵ Terminology

> ① Homomorphism: For two groups (G, ·), (H, *), a map ρ such that ρ(u · v) = ρ(u) * ρ(v), ρ: G → H

> ② Isomorphism: A homomorphism that satisfies bijective

> ③ Product Group: Defined as the Cartesian product G × H from two groups G, H (e.g., (g<sub>1</sub>, h<sub>1</sub>))

>> ○ New group operation is defined as (g<sub>1</sub>, h<sub>1</sub>)·(g<sub>2</sub>, h<sub>2</sub>) = (g<sub>1</sub>g<sub>2</sub>, h<sub>1</sub>h<sub>2</sub>)

> ④ Commutativity: A group (G, +) is commutative or Abelian if the operation order does not matter, i.e., a·b = b·a

>> ○ If this property does not hold for all elements of the group, the group is non-commutative

>> ○ Finite commutative groups can be expressed as products of cyclic groups

> ⑤ Group Action: Defined as a function T: G × X → X that maps a pair (g, x) to an element in X

>> ○ **Condition 1.** For the identity element e of G, T(e, x) = x

>> ○ **Condition 2.** For g<sub>1</sub>, g<sub>2</sub> ∈ G, T(g<sub>1</sub>, T(g<sub>2</sub>, x)) = T(g<sub>1</sub>g<sub>2</sub>, x)

>> ○ Simplified notation: Represent T(g, x) as T<sub>g</sub>(x), meaning point x is mapped to gx (= T<sub>g</sub>(x))

> ⑥ Invariance: A function ϕ: X → Y has G-invariance if for all g ∈ G and x ∈ X, ϕ(x) = ϕ(gx)

>> ○ This implies that the group action on the input space has no effect on the output

> ⑦ Equivariance: A function ϕ: X → Y has G-equivariance if for all g ∈ G and x ∈ X, ϕ(gx) = g'ϕ(x)

>> ○ Here, g' ∈ G' is homomorphic to G and acts on the output space

>> ○ Equivariance implies that the group action on the input space induces a corresponding group action on the output space

> ⑧ Orbit: For a point x ∈ X, the orbit Gx is defined as the set {gx: g ∈ G}

>> ○ For example, if G is a translation group and x is an image, the orbit represents all shifted versions of the image

> ⑨ Homogeneous Space: A space X where for any pair x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> ∈ X, there exists g ∈ G such that gx<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ A homogeneous space X with a group action G is also called a G-space

> ⑩ Representation: A representation of a group G is a map ρ: G → GL(V), where GL(V) is the group of linear transformations on vector space V

>> ○ Homomorphism condition: Representations must satisfy ρ(g<sub>1</sub>g<sub>2</sub>) = ρ(g<sub>1</sub>)ρ(g<sub>2</sub>)

>> ○ In many cases, V is ℝ<sup>n</sup> or ℂ<sup>n</sup>

>> ○ Reducible: If the representation can be decomposed into a direct sum of other representations

>> ○ Irreducible: All representations that are not reducible. The set of irreducible representations is denoted Irr(G), irreps, etc.

>> ○ Irreducible representations of finite commutative groups are all one-dimensional and are in bijection with the group itself

>> ○ Irreducible representations of finite commutative groups are classified as products of cyclic groups ℤ/nℤ

 ⑶ **Theorem 1.** Each axiom of the group 〈G, *〉 is a structural property of 〈G, *〉

> ① Definition: Structural property of 〈G, *〉 refers to properties shared by all binary structures isomorphic to 〈G, *〉

> ② Premise: Through isomorphism φ: G → S, 〈S, ㆍ〉 is a binary structure isomorphic to 〈G, *〉

> ③ Proof for Axiom 1: For α, β, γ ∈ S, ∃ a, b, c ∈ G such that φ(a) = α, φ(b) = β, φ(c) = γ

## **2\. Functions**

⑴ Injective Function: A function _f_**:** _X_ → _Y_ where each element in the range corresponds to exactly one element in the domain

⑵ Surjective Function: A function where the codomain equals the range

⑶ Bijective Function: A function that is both injective and surjective
