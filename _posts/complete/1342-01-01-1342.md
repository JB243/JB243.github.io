## **3\. Solubility**

 ⑴ Basic Principles of Solubility

> ① Enthalpy of Solution

>> ○ ΔHsolution = ΔHlattice \+ ΔHhydration **:** M+(g) + N-(g) → M+(_aq_) + N-(_aq_)

>> ○ ΔHlattice, lattice (< 0) **:** M+(_g_) + N-(_g_) → MN(_s_)

>>> ○ Smaller metal ion radii lead to greater absolute values of lattice enthalpy

>> ○ ΔH<sub>hydration</sub>, hydration (0 ± ) **:** MN(_s_) → M+(_aq_) + N-(_aq_)

> ② Hydration **:** Surrounding of solute particles by water molecules in a solution

>> ○ Ionic solutes **:** Smaller ions and higher charges lead to stronger hydration

>> ○ Hydration leads to ordered water molecules, resulting in a decrease in solvent entropy

>> ○ Hydration disrupts the regular structure of solute particles, leading to an increase in solute entropy

>> ○ Hydration is an entropy-increasing process

>> ○ Entropy change upon evaporation of pure solvent = Gas entropy - Solvent entropy > Gas entropy - Solution entropy = Solution's evaporation entropy

 ⑵ Temperature and Solubility

> ① Solubility of Solids **:** Increases with temperature, endothermic reaction (ΔHsolution > 0)

> ② Solubility of Gases (applies to some solids as well) **:** Decreases with temperature, exothermic reaction (ΔHsolution < 0)

> ③ Henry's Law

>> ○ **Formula: **Concentration (C) in solution = Henry's constant (K) × Partial pressure (P) of gas

>> ○ Gas solubility is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas

>> ○ Applicable mostly to gases with low solubility

>> ○ Derivation of Henry's Law

 ⑶ Polarity and Solubility **:** "Like dissolves like"

> ① Polar solvents dissolve polar solutes effectively

> ② Nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes effectively

## **4\. General Properties of Solutions**

 ⑴ Definition

> ① Properties related to the number of particles of solute, regardless of the type of solute

> ② Under the assumption of ideal solutions, entropy is the underlying factor for all general properties

 ⑵ Van't Hoff Factor **:** denoted as i

> ① Definition

> ② Example **:** When NaCl(_s_) is dissolved in water, it completely dissociates into Na+(_aq_) and Cl-(_aq_), so the Van't Hoff factor is 2

> ③ Real Solutions **:** As concentration becomes higher and the ion charges are larger, more ion pairs form in the solution, causing i to decrease

> ④ Ionization Degree and Van't Hoff Factor

 ⑶ Lowering of Vapor Pressure

> ① Raoult's Law

>> ○ **Content 1.** In equilibrium, the partial pressure of each component is proportional to the mole fraction of the component in the liquid mixture

>> ○ **Content 2.** The volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing

>> ○ **Content 3.** Intermolecular interactions in the mixture are the same as those between pure components

>> ○ Relevant equation

> ② When both the solvent and solute form vapor pressure

> ③ Ideal Solutions (↔ Non-ideal Solutions) **:** Solutions that satisfy Raoult's Law

**Figure 1.** Raoult's Law and Positive Deviations, Negative Deviations [Footnote:1]

>> ○ Solution with P = Super-saturated Solution with P: ΔH Solubilization = 0

>> ○ Solution with P < Super-saturated Solution with P: Solvent dislikes vaporization, vapor pressure decreases ⇔ Strong solute-solvent interaction ⇔ ΔH Solubilization < 0

>> ○ Solution with P > Super-saturated Solution with P: Solvent tends to vaporize, vapor pressure increases ⇔ Weak solute-solvent interaction ⇔ ΔH Solubilization > 0

> ④ Fractional Distillation of Ideal Solutions: Ideal solutions have different compositions in liquid and gas phases → Repetitive vaporization and condensation allow for the extraction of pure components

 ⑷ Boiling Point Elevation: 1st approximation, valid for dilute solutions and small temperature changes

 ⑸ Freezing Point Depression: 1st approximation, valid for dilute solutions and small temperature changes

> ① Molal Depression Constant Kf is a property of the **solvent**, not the solute

 ⑹ Osmotic Phenomenon (osmosis)

> ① Osmosis

>> ○ Phenomenon where solvent molecules move due to differences in concentration between two solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane (diffusion of free molecules)

>> ○ Osmotic Pressure: Pressure needed to prevent osmosis. Formulated using van 't Hoff's law

π = CRT × i

>> ○ Similarity of osmotic pressure formula to ideal gas equation: Due to the dilute nature of solute molecules in solution, they behave like an ideal gas

> ② Reverse Osmosis

>> ○ When pressure greater than osmotic pressure is applied, water moves from high concentration to low concentration

>> ○ Theoretical pressure needed in reverse osmosis = Pressure needed to establish equilibrium when some water is removed and osmotic pressure increases

## **5. Colloids**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Particles ranging from 1 μm to 1,000 μm dispersed in a gas or liquid medium

> ② Particles dispersed in a gas are called aerosols

 ⑵ Properties: Particle size

> ① Tyndall Phenomenon

>> ○ Definition: The path of light becomes visible due to particles within the colloid

>> ○ [Rayleigh Scattering](https://jb243.github.io/pages/750) and Tyndall Phenomenon both scatter specific wavelengths, but conditions and paths of scattering differ

>> ○ No accurate mathematical formula describing Tyndall Phenomenon exists to date

> ② Dialysis: Diffusion of substances through a semipermeable membrane

>> ○ Dialysis solution concentration > Solution concentration: Substance moves from dialysis solution to solution

>> ○ Dialysis solution concentration = Solution concentration: No substance movement

>> ○ Dialysis solution concentration < Solution concentration: Substance moves from solution to dialysis solution

>> ○ Renal hemodialysis is a representative application

> ③ Adsorption

> ④ Brownian Motion: Random motion of colloidal particles in a liquid medium

>> ○ Einstein analyzed it mathematically and received the Nobel Prize

>> ○ Application: Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measures scattered light reflecting Brownian motion to determine particle size

> ② Zeta Potential

**Figure. 4.** Concept of Zeta Potential]

**Figure. 5.** Zeta potential patterns based on particle type

>> ○ Background theory

>>> ○ Oppositely charged particles gather around the charged particle to form a primary shell

>>> ○ Stern Layer: Primary shell

>>>> ○ Polar particles gather around the Stern Layer to form a secondary shell

>>>> ○ Stern Layer moves with the particle

>>> ○ Double Layer: Secondary shell, also known as DEL (Double Electrode Layer)

>>>> ○ Secondary shell can be of the same or different polarity as the initial particle

>>>> ○ Movement influenced by solvent more than particles

>> ○ Zeta Potential

>>> ○ Definition: Potential at the surface of the double layer

>>> ○ Measurable unlike surface potential or stern potential

>>> ○ Zeta potential can be measured by observing the difference in particle movement speed when applying potential

>> ○ Utility 1: Measures particle polarity

>> ○ Utility 2: Reflects both charge state and particle dispersion

>>> ○ If particles have the same charge and large zeta potential, they won't aggregate

>>> ○ Absolute value of zeta potential exceeding 30 mV prevents aggregation between particles

>>> ○ Due to the emergence of repulsive forces

> ③ Aggregation (Flocculation)

>> ○ Colloidal particles aggregate due to electrostatic forces between particles, forming small clumps

>> ○ Differentiated from coagulation by the precipitation of solute and solvent together

>> ○ Schulze-Hardy (S-H) rule: Aggregation strength proportional to electrostatic forces between solutes. Proposed around [125 years ago](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927775721009535)

>> ○ Factor 1: Ion concentration: Aggregation occurs faster with more positive and negative solutes

>> ○ Factor 2: Higher charge of solute increases aggregation strength

> ④ Salting-out

**Figure. 6.** Salting-out phenomenon

>> ○ Differentiated from flocculation by the precipitation of solute only

>> ○ Low concentration salt: Solubility increases with added salt (salting-in) due to salt-induced alteration aiding water penetration

>> ○ High concentration salt: Solubility decreases with added salt (salting-out) as salts reduce interaction between substance and water

>> ○ Peak solubility values increase with higher target substance concentration

>> ○ Initial means of purification, ammonium sulfate used extensively

>> ○ Application: Used in making tofu by adding a coagulant (MgCl2)
