## **1** **. Acyl-Carnitine Cycle** 

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Formation of Acetyl-CoA from pyruvate in the mitochondrial matrix.

> ① Saturated fatty acids

>> ○ Acyl coA synthetase on the **outer mitochondrial membrane** forms acyl-coA by attaching coA to fatty acids after removing ppi from ATP.

>> ○ ppi is broken down into 2pi by pyrophosphatase.

>> ○ Carnitine acyltransferase 1 on the outer membrane replaces coA with carnitine.

>> ○ Acyl carnitine is transported by translocase in the inner membrane.

>> ○ Acyl carnitine is converted back to acyl coA by carnitine acyltransferase 2 in the inner membrane.

>> ○ Acyl coA →  trans-Δ2 enoyl coA → L-3-hydroxyacyl coA (Enzyme: acyl coA dehydrogenase)

>> ○ L-3-hydroxyacyl coA → 3-ketoacyl coA (Enzyme: L-3-hydroxyacyl coA dehydrogenase)

>> ○ 3-ketoacyl coA → acyl coA (n-2) + **acetyl coA** (Enzyme: β-ketothiolase)

> ② Unsaturated fatty acids

>> ○ Isomerase and reductase are additionally involved, producing propionyl coA and succinyl coA.

>> ○ Propionyl coA (3C) + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> → methylmalonyl coA (4C) (Enzyme: propionyl coA carboxylase)

>> ○ Methylmalonyl coA (4C) → succinyl coA (Enzyme: mutase)

⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Acyl-Carnitine Cycle: Acetyl-CoA cannot pass through the mitochondrial inner membrane.

> ① 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate → Citrate

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Citrate can directly pass through the mitochondrial inner membrane.

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Decomposes into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm.

## **2\. Anabolism**

 ⑴ **Anabolism 1.** Fatty acid synthesis

> ① Animal cells: In the **cytoplasm**, acetyl-CoA utilizes ATP and NADPH for fatty acid synthesis.

>> ○ In animal cells, NADPH is synthesized via the [pentose phosphate pathway](https://jb243.github.io/pages/70).

>> ○ Acetyl coA + ATP + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> → malonyl coA + ADP + P<sub>i</sub>

>>> ○ Enzyme: Acetyl coA carboxylase

>>> ○ Cofactor: Biotin

> ② Plant Cells: Fatty acid synthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, plastids.

⑵ **Anabolism 2.** Saturated fatty acid synthesis

> ① Animal Cells

>> ○ In the cytoplasm, fatty acids can be synthesized up to C-16, which is palmitic acid, in terms of carbon number.

>> ○ The elongation of palmitic acid into longer fatty acids occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and, to some extent, in mitochondria.

> ② **Type 1.** Lauric acid: (12:0)

>> ○ 12 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ③ **Type 2.** Myristic acid: (14:0)

>> ○ 14 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ④ **Type 3.** Palmitic acid: (16:0)

>> ○ 16 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ⑤ **Type 4.** Stearic acid: (18:0)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 0 double bonds

⑶ **Anabolism 3.** Unsaturated fatty acid synthesis

> ① Animal cells: Desaturase enzymes that form double bonds are located in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

> ② Plant cells: Desaturase enzymes that form double bonds are located in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplasts.

> ③ **Type 1.** Palmitoleic acid: (16:1)

>> ○ 16 carbons, 1 double bond

>> ○ ω-7: First alkene formation at the 7th carbon from the methyl end.

> ④ **Type 2.** Oleic acid: (18:1)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 1 double bond

>> ○ ω-9: First alkene formation at the 9th carbon from the methyl end.

> ⑤ **Type 3.** Linoleic acid: (18:2)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 2 double bonds

>> ○ ω-6: First alkene formation at the 6th carbon from the methyl end.

> ⑥ **Type 4.** α-Linolenic acid: (18:3)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 3 double bonds

>> ○ ω-3: First alkene formation at the 3rd carbon from the methyl end.

>> ○ Found in vegetables and vegetable oils (corn oil).

>> ○ Prevents skin diseases and has growth factors.

> ⑦ **Type 5.** Arachidonic acid: (20:4)

>> ○ 20 carbons, 4 double bonds

>> ○ ω-6: First alkene formation at the 6th carbon from the methyl end.

>> ○ Found in animal fats and prevents skin diseases.

> ⑧ Omega 3 fatty acids

>> ○ Unsaturated fatty acids forming the first alkene at the 3rd carbon from the methyl end.

>> ○ Promote red blood cell aggregation and prostaglandin production, preventing heart disease: Also thought to prevent cancer.

>> ○ EPA, DHA: Omega 3 fatty acids abundant in fish.

>> ○ DHA: Good for brain development in young children.

> ⑨ Linoleic acid → Arachidonic acid

> ⑩ Arachidonic acid → PG, Thromboxane

>> ○ Mediating enzyme: C.O.X

>> ○ PG: Increases blood clotting, headaches, uterine contractions, set point, and gastric mucosa formation.

>> ○ Thromboxane: Forms platelets.

>> ○ Arachidonic acid → Leukotriene

>> ○ PG, Thromboxane, Leukotriene: Self-degrade.

 **Figure 1.** Cholesterol Synthesis

<br>

> ① Cholesterol synthesis reaction: Occurs in the liver.

>> ○ **Step 1.** 2 × acetyl-CoA → acetoacetyl CoA

>> ○ **Step 2.** acetyl-CoA + acetoacetyl CoA + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2NADPH → HMG-coA (cytoplasm)

>> ○ **Step 3.** HMG-coA → mevalonate: **Rate-determining step**

>> ○ **Step 4.** Formation of isoprene (C5): Mevalonate → isopentenyl pyrophosphate (PPP) by decarboxylation

>> ○ **Step 5.** Isopentyl pyrophosphate (C6) → squalene (C30)

>> ○ **Step 6.** Cyclic formation of squalene → cholesterol

> ② Cholesterol acts as a precursor for various substances.

>> ○ Bile salts

>> ○ Steroid synthesis

>> ○ Cholesterol → Androstenedione → (Aromatization) → Estrone

> ③ Mitochondria: Mevalonate → HMG-coA → acetoacetyl coA + acetyl coA (decomposition reaction)

> ④ Bacteria lack the ability to synthesize cholesterol.

>> ○ Instead, they produce hopanoids to regulate membrane fluidity.

>> ○ However, Mycoplasma obtains cholesterol from the environment and uses it to regulate membrane fluidity.

 ⑸ **Anabolism 5.** Ketone body synthesis

> ① Ketone bodies form when acetyl-CoA accumulates.

> ② Ketone bodies are converted back to acetyl-CoA in the brain, heart, kidneys, etc., and used to generate ATP.

 ⑹ **Anabolism 6.** Phospholipid synthesis

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Fatty acids move to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Converted to fatty acid-acyl-CoA.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. G3P synthesized in the cytoplasm moves to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. A substituent combines with two fatty-acid-acyl-CoAs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form phosphatidic acid.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Phosphatidic acid is used for the synthesis of triacylglycerol or phospholipids.
