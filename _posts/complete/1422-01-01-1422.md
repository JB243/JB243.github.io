## **1** **. Acyl-Carnitine Cycle** 

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Formation of Acetyl-CoA from Pyruvate in the Mitochondrial Matrix

> ① Saturated Fatty Acids

>> ○ Acyl coA synthetase on the **outer mitochondrial membrane** forms acyl-coA by attaching coA to fatty acids after removing ppi from ATP

>> ○ ppi is broken down into 2pi by pyrophosphatase

>> ○ Carnitine acyltransferase 1 on the outer membrane replaces coA with carnitine

>> ○ Acyl carnitine is transported by translocase in the inner membrane

>> ○ Acyl carnitine is converted back to acyl coA by carnitine acyltransferase 2 in the inner membrane

>> ○ Acyl coA →  trans-Δ2 enoyl coA → L-3-hydroxyacyl coA (enzyme **: **acyl coA dehydrogenase)

>> ○ L-3-hydroxyacyl coA → 3-ketoacyl coA (enzyme **:** L-3-hydroxyacyl coA dehydrogenase)

>> ○ 3-ketoacyl coA → acyl coA (n-2) + **acetyl coA** (enzyme **:** β-ketothiolase)

> ② Unsaturated Fatty Acids

>> ○ Isomerase and reductase are additionally involved, producing propionyl coA and succinyl coA

>> ○ propionyl coA (3C) + HCO3- → methylmalonyl coA (4C) (enzyme **:** propionyl coA carboxylase)

>> ○ methylmalonyl coA (4C) → succinyl coA (enzyme **:** mutase)

 ⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Acyl-Carnitine Cycle **:** Acetyl-CoA cannot pass through the mitochondrial inner membrane

> ① 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate → Citrate

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Citrate can directly pass through the mitochondrial inner membrane

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Decomposes into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm

## **2\. Anabolism**

 ⑴ **Anabolism 1.** Fatty Acid Synthesis

> ① Animal Cells **:** In the **cytoplasm**, acetyl-CoA utilizes ATP and NADPH for fatty acid synthesis

>> ○ In animal cells, NADPH is synthesized via the [pentose phosphate pathway](https://jb243.github.io/pages/70)(pentose pathway)

>> ○ acetyl coA + ATP + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> → malonyl coA + ADP + Pi

>>> ○ Enzyme **:** acetyl coA carboxylase

>>> ○ Cofactor **:** Biotin

> ② Plant Cells **:** Fatty acid synthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, plastids

⑵ **Anabolism 2.** Saturated Fatty Acid Synthesis

> ① Animal Cells

>> ○ In the cytoplasm, lipids can be synthesized up to C-16, which is palmitic acid.

>> ○ The elongation of palmitic acid into longer fatty acids occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and, to some extent, in mitochondria

>> ○ 12 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ③ **Type 2.** Myristic acid **:** (14 **:** 0)

>> ○ 14 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ④ **Type 3.** Palmitic acid **:** (16 **:** 0)

>> ○ 16 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ⑤ **Type 4.** Stearic acid **:** (18 **:** 0)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 0 double bonds

⑶ **Anabolism 3.** Unsaturated Fatty Acid Synthesis

> ① Animal Cells **:** Desaturase enzymes that form double bonds are located in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum

> ② Plant Cells **:** Desaturase enzymes that form double bonds are located in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplasts

> ③ **Type 1.** Palmitoleic acid **:** (16 **:** 1)

>> ○ 16 carbons, 1 double bond

>> ○ ω-7 **:** First alkene formation at the 7th carbon from the methyl end

> ④ **Type 2.** Oleic acid **:** (18 **:** 1)

>> ○ Found in vegetables and vegetable oils (corn oil)

>> ○ Prevents skin diseases and has growth factors

> ⑦ **Type 5.** Arachidonic acid **:** (20 **:** 4)

>> ○ 20 carbons, 4 double bonds

>> ○ ω-6 **:** First alkene formation at the 6th carbon from the methyl end

>> ○ Found in animal fats and prevents skin diseases

> ⑧ Omega 3 Fatty Acids

>> ○ Promote red blood cell aggregation and prostaglandin production, preventing heart disease **:** Also thought to prevent cancer

>> ○ EPA, DHA **:** Omega 3 fatty acids abundant in fish

>> ○ DHA **:** Good for brain development in young children

> ⑨ Linoleic acid → Arachidonic acid

> ⑩ Arachidonic acid → PG, Thromboxane

>> ○ Mediating enzyme **:** C.O.X

>> ○ PG **:** Increases blood clotting, headaches, uterine contractions, set point, and gastric mucosa formation

 **Figure. 1.** Cholesterol Synthesis

<br>

> ① Cholesterol synthesis reaction **:** Occurs in the liver

>> ○ **Step 1.** 2 × acetyl-CoA → acetoacetyl CoA

>> ○ **Step 2.** acetyl-CoA + acetoacetyl CoA + H2O + 2NADPH → HMG-coA (cytoplasm)

>> ○ **Step 3.** HMG-coA → mevalonate **:** **Rate-determining step**

>> ○ **Step 4.** Formation of isoprene (C5) **:** Mevalonate → isopentenyl pyrophosphate (PPP) by decarboxylation

>> ○ **Step 5.** isopentyl pyrophosphate (C6) → squalene (C30)

>> ○ **Step 6.** Cyclic formation of squalene → cholesterol

> ② Cholesterol acts as a precursor for various substances

>> ○ Bile salts

>> ○ Steroid synthesis

>> ○ Cholesterol → Androstenedione → (Aromatization) → Estrone

> ③ Mitochondria **:** Mevalonate → HMG-coA → acetoacetyl coA + acetyl coA (decomposition reaction)

> ④ Bacteria lack the ability to synthesize cholesterol

>> ○ Instead, they produce hopanoids to regulate membrane fluidity

>> ○ However, Mycoplasma obtains cholesterol from the environment and uses it to regulate membrane fluidity

 ⑸ **Anabolism 5.** Ketone Body Synthesis

> ① Ketone bodies form when acetyl-CoA accumulates

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Converted to fatty acyl-CoA

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. G3P synthesized in the cytoplasm moves to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. A head group combines with two fatty acyl-CoAs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form phosphatidic acid

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Phosphatidic acid is used for the synthesis of triacylglycerol or phospholipids
