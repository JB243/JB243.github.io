## **1\.** Velocity and Speed

 ⑴ Velocity **:** Displacement per unit time, a vector quantity

 ⑵ Speed **:** Distance traveled per unit time, a scalar quantity

 ⑶ Average velocity **:** Total displacement divided by total time of travel

 ⑷ Instantaneous velocity **:** Distance traveled over an extremely short time interval divided by time

 ⑸ Relative velocity

> ① Relative velocity of A with respect to B

> ② Useful formula for vector calculations

> ③ **Example:** Finding the distance to the point of origin of thunder and lightning when lightning is seen Δt seconds before the sound of thunder occurs

>> ○ Lightning **:** A flash of light. Therefore, lightning almost instantaneously reaches the observer as its speed is the speed of light, 3.0 × 108 m/s.

>> ○ Thunder **:** A discharge phenomenon in the atmosphere. The speed of sound is 340 m/s.

>> ○ Distance to the point of origin of thunder and lightning = 340 Δt (m)

## **2\. Acceleration**

 ⑴ Acceleration **:** Rate of change of velocity per unit time

 ⑵ Uniformly accelerated motion

## **3\. Examples of Motion**

 ⑴ Free Fall

> ① Definition **:** v0 = 0, a = g = 9.81 m/s²

> ② **Formula 1.** v = gt

> ③ **Formula 2.** s = ½ gt²

> ③ **Formula 3.** 2gh = v²

 ⑵ Vertical Upward Projection

> ① Definition **:** v0 > 0, a = g

> ② **Formula 1.** v = v0 + gt

> ③ **Formula 2.** s = v0t + ½ gt²

> ④ **Formula 3.** 2gh = v² - v0²

 ⑶ Vertical Downward Projection

> ① Definition **:** v0 > 0, a = -g

> ② **Formula 1.** v = v0 - gt

> ③ **Formula 2.** s = v0t - ½ gt²

> ④ **Formula 3.** -2gh = v² - v0²

 ⑷ Projectile Motion

> ① Definition **:** 2D motion of an object (projectile) thrown upwards

>> ○ Horizontal motion at constant speed

>> ○ Vertical upward projection

> ② Initial velocity v0, with an angle θ with respect to the ground

## **4\. Velocity and Acceleration Experiment**

 ⑴ Experimental Procedure

> ① Set up the air track to be horizontal, install Photogate 1 and Photogate 2

> ② Ensure that the distance L between the two Photogates is significantly larger than the length d of the glider, measure L and d

> ③ Configure the Photogates to measure the time interval during which light is blocked as it goes from the emitter to the receiver as the glider passes through each Photogate

> ④ Connect a mass m to the glider with mass M, set up the apparatus, and release the glider

> ⑤ Measure the time interval Δt1 when the glider passes through Photogate 1, blocking the light

> ⑥ Similarly, measure the time interval Δt2 when the glider passes through Photogate 2, blocking the light

 ⑵ Calculations

> ① Instantaneous velocity v1 when the glider passes through Photogate 1 **:** Approximated using average velocity

> ② Instantaneous velocity v2 when the glider passes through Photogate 2 **:** Approximated using average velocity

> ③ Magnitude of the glider's acceleration a **:** Using uniformly accelerated motion formulas
