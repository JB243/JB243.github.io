## **1**. Purpose

I have been running a blog since 2007 for 18 years. I created MyGPT, a system that can easily answer questions related to my blog by crawling it. Through this, I want to conduct experiments to confirm four types of questions. First, can training a Large Language Model (LLM) to actively refer to a database of true knowledge reduce the LLM's inherent hallucinations? Second, if an LLM is trained to learn refined value evaluation standards that can be shared with the public, can it improve people's irrational judgments? Third, can an LLM discern the intrinsic contradictions in information that is judged to be correct on the surface? Fourth, is it possible to realize a cyber ego that shares my value assessments on the internet space?

<br>

⑴ **Effect 1.** **Judgment Based on Truth**

> ① Strategy to actively refer to a database of true knowledge to prevent the hallucination often possessed by LLMs

 ⑵ **Effect 2.** **AI-assisted Decision**

> ① Since humans often make irrational decisions, they frequently fail significantly

> ② If you save your beliefs and values in ChatGPT and use it when making important decisions, it could reduce the frequency of such failures

> ③ **Example 1.** Celebrities or influencers, when writing an apology after making a mistake, often make the situation worse due to emotionally biased judgments

> ④ **Example 2.** For example, I have a private valuation and [public valuation
system](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2273), and I am cautious about making private value judgments in public places

 ⑶ **Effect 3.** [**Reviewer
AI**](https://jb243.github.io/pages/notice/1758#:4.-,AI,-% 20)

> ① A model that periodically points out errors: Here, errors can include both [fact judgments](https://jb243.github.io/pages/387) and [value judgments](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2273)

> ② This can not only create an opportunity to make oneself a more consistent being but also discover truly precious value judgments that were not consciously considered before

 ⑷ **Effect 4.** **Experiment in Creating an AI with Self**

> ① Effort to eternally preserve my self

> ② Or the task of creating a cyber friend resembling me

<br>

 ⑴ **Step 1.** [Blog Crawling](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2291) → [Markdown Conversion](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1892#:-,HTMLtoMarkDown,-!pipinstallhtml2text) → Text Preprocessing (e.g., indenting, marking titles) → Markdown Merge (12.4 MB)

 ⑵ **Step 2.** Click Explore GPTs on the top left

 ⑶ **Step 3.** Click +Create on the top right

 ⑷ **Step 4.** Click Configure

 ⑸ **Step 5.** Upload Thumbnail

 ⑹ **Step 6.** Enter Name, Description, Instructions, Conversation starters

> ① **Conversation starters:** Example questions. It's important to pay attention to prompt engineering because the intended answers often do not emerge, and thus, it's crucial to provide suitable example questions

 ⑺ **Step 7.** Knowledge

> ① If you upload files under Knowledge, conversations with your GPT may include file contents. Files can be downloaded when Code Interpreter is enabled The following files are only available for Code Interpreter:

> ② **Upload files:** In my case, there was a size limit for the 12.4 MB file, but success was achieved by compressing it into a .zip file (4 MB)

 ⑻ **Step 8.** Capabilities

> ① Web Browsing, DALL·E Image Generation, Code Interpreter can be enabled/disabled

> ② Code Interpreter: If you have uploaded a file and intend to use it in chat, it must be enabled

> ③ Code Intrepreter lets your GPT run code. When enabled, your GPT can analyze data, work with, files you've uploaded, do math and more

 ⑼ **Step 9.** Actions

<br>

> ① Currently, I have implemented a ChatGPT at the level of a blog search engine without modifying this section at all

> ② A thorough review of this section seems necessary for better performance

 ⑽ **Step 10.** Additional Settings

> ① Use conversation data in your GPT to improve our models.

 ⑾ **Step 11.** Click the 'Save ⋁' button on the top right

 ⑿ **Step 12.** Choose Publish to

> ① Select one of Only me, Anyone with a link, Everyone

 ⒀ **Step 13.** Choose Category

> ① Select one of DALL·E, Writing, Productivity, Research & Analysis, Programming, Education, Lifestyle, Other

 ⒁ **Step 14.** Click Confirm

 ⒂ **Step 15.** After clicking the newly created MyGPT, clicking Name allows you to choose one of the following

> ① New Chat

> ② About

> ③ Edit GPT

> ④ Hide from sidebar

> ⑤ Copy link

> ⑥ Report

 ⒃ **Step 16.** Deployment: Simply by sharing the following link, you can distribute MyGPT to ChatGPT 4.0 users

<br>

 ⑹ **Example 6.** Currently, blog-to-chatbot is not much different from a search engine (a bit smarter, but still often wrong) (**Important**)
