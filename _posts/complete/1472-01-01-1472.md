## **1.** [Mutagens](https://jb243.github.io/pages/71)

<br>

<br>

## **2.** Original Mark

⑴ Methylates the A base of the template strand to mark it as the original.

⑵ Dna methylase is involved.

⑶ Methylates the 5'-GATC-3' sequence in the ori C region.

<br>

<br>

## **3. Correction**

⑴ DNA polymerase has correction functions, and the replication error rate is 1/10<sup>7</sup>.

⑵ **Mechanism 1.** Exonuclease

⑶ **Mechanism 2.** 3' → 5' correction (DNA pol I, II, III): The 3' → 5' exonuclease activity allows correction of errors that occur during DNA synthesis.

⑷ **Mechanism 3.** 5' → 3' correction (DNA pol I): 5' → 3' exonuclease activity

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Repair**

⑴ If repair enzymes correct errors, the replication error rate is 1/10<sup>9</sup>.

⑵ **Type 1.** Dimer recovery

**Figure 1.** Dimer recovery mechanism

<br>

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Ultraviolet light induces pyrimidine dimers (TT) between adjacent thymines.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. DNA photolyase recognizes changes in the phosphodiester backbone and binds to the pyrimidine dimer.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. DNA photolyase absorbs blue light (visible light over 300 nm) and becomes activated.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. The activated DNA photolyase separates thymine from the DNA.

⑶ **Type 2.** Excision Repair

> ① Overview

>> ○ The most common repair system capable of fixing various structural damages in DNA.

>> ○ Best characterized in E. coli, with various modified repair mechanisms present in other organisms.

> ② **Type 2-1.** Mismatch excision repair

>> ○ Characteristics: Uses original marks, Mut proteins, and DNA pol III.

> ③ **Type 2-2.** Base excision repair

>> ○ Definition: A repair method for cases where bases are damaged by oxidation, alkylation, hydrolysis, or deamination, forming U bases.

>> ○ **Process 1.** DNA glycosylase cleaves between the damaged base and the pentose sugar, removing only the base.

>> ○ **Process 2.** AP endonuclease cleaves the sugar-phosphate backbone at the 5' side of the AP site where only the base has been removed.

>>> ○ AP: apurine or apyrimidine

>> ○ **Process 3.** AP lyase, endonuclease, phosphodiesterase: Remove the remaining parts of the damaged nucleotide.

>> ○ **Process 4.** DNA polymerase: Synthesizes nucleotides in the removed region.

>>> ○ In E. coli, DNA pol I is involved, while in mammals, DNA pol β is involved.

>> ○ **Process 5.** DNA ligase: Seals the nick.

> ④ **Type 2-3.** Nucleotide excision repair

>> ○ Definition: A repair process for large, helix-distorting damages such as pyrimidine dimers.

>> ○ **Process 1.** Incision step

>>> ○ **Step 1-1.** Repair endonuclease: Recognizes and cleaves the distorted region caused by thymine dimers.

>>> ○ **Step 1-2.** Cuts the sugar-phosphate bond 8 nucleotides upstream of the thymine dimer on the 5' side.

>>> ○ **Step 1-3.** Cleaves the sugar-phosphate bond 4–5 nucleotides downstream of the thymine dimer on the 3' side.

>>> ○ Ultimately, two cuts are made 12–13 nucleotides apart.

>>> ○ Helicase and exonuclease are involved in steps **1-2** and **1-3**.

>> ○ **Process 2.** DNA polymerase I (pol I) binds to the 3'-OH group at the end of the cut site.

>>> ○ **Step 2-1.** Removes the DNA fragment containing the thymine dimer while synthesizing a new strand.

>>> ○ **Step 2-2.** In eukaryotes, DNA pol ε/δ is involved.

>> ○ **Process 3.** Ligase seals the newly synthesized fragment into the original DNA strand.

⑷ **Type 3.** High-fidelity post-replication repair: Increased Lex A protein → Increased accuracy

⑸ **Type 4.** SOS repair: Emergency repair mechanism. Decreased Lex A protein → Increased Rec A protein activity → Decreased accuracy

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Failure of DNA Correction and Repair**

⑴ Leads to frequent mutations.
