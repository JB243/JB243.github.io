## **2. Enzyme**

⑴ Metabolism : All chemical reactions in the body

> ① Gibbs Free Energy :  ΔH - TΔS < 0, the response is spontaneous

> ② Considered as ΔH ≒ ΔG in biology

>> ○ Exothermic reaction : ΔH < 0, related to catabolism

>> ○ Endothermic reaction : ΔH > 0, related to anabolism

> ③ Even if the reaction is spontaneous, if the activation energy (threshold energy) is too high, the reaction may be slow

> ④ Activation energy

>> ○ Definition : Minimum energy required for reaction molecules to trigger chemical reactions

>> ○ Lower activation energy increases the reaction rate by increasing the number of molecules that can react

>> ○ Catalyst : It increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy in combination with the substrate

>> ○ Enzyme : Biocatalyst

⑵ Characteristic

> ① Feature 1. Substrate specificity : The enzyme acts only on a specific substrate that conforms to its active site and conforms to the reaction catalyst.

>> ○ Lock and key model : Model where the active site of the enzyme is completely consistent with the substrate

>> ○ Induced fit model : The model that the enzyme turns into a completely complementary structure that fits the substrate when it is bound to the substrate.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The shape of the substrate is approximately similar to the enzyme active site

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. When the substrate binds to the active site, the enzyme changes shape and the chemical bond is pressed.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Changes in shape break down substrates and release monomers

>> ○ Isozyme (enzyme multiplicity)

>>> ○ Different enzymes involved in the same biochemical reaction

>>> ○ Have different characteristics depending on the cell that acts (eg : hexokinase, lactose dehydrogenase (LDH)

> ④ Feature 3. The enzyme only affects the reaction rate but does not affect the size of the reaction heat.
 
> ⑤ Feature 4. From common ancestors : When other organisms use the same enzymes 

⑵ Composition of enzymes

> ⑥ Differential binding of the transition state complex

⑷ Factors affecting the action of enzymes

> ① Factor 1. Substrate concentration

>> ○ Related to Michaelis-Menten Equation

>> ○ Initial reaction rate increases with increasing substrate concentration and then becomes constant after reaching a certain level

>> ○ Once all the enzymes are saturated with the substrate, the initial reaction rate no longer increases with increasing substrate concentration.

> ② Factor 2. Temperature

>> ○ As temperature increases, the number of molecules with kinetic energy above the activation energy increases, increasing the reaction rate.

>> ○ The chemical reaction involving enzymes is the fastest at the optimum temperature at which the enzyme has the optimum conformation

>> ○ When the temperature is above the optimum temperature, the protein is irreversibly denatured by heat, and the protein is not recovered even at a lower temperature

> ③ Factor 3. PH

>> ○ The chemical reaction involving enzymes is the fastest at the optimum pH

>> ○ The charged state of the amino acid residues that make up the enzyme depends on the change in the concentration of hydrogen ions, so if it is out of optimum pH, it changes the net charge of the protein, causing electrostatic repulsion and altering the conformation of the enzyme.

>> ○ Example : Pepsin 1.5, catalace : 7.6, trypsin : 7.7, puma race : 7.8, ribonucleace : 7.8, Argenes : 9.7

> ④ Enzyme Reaction Rate Index

⑹ Michaelis-Menten Equation

⑺ Inhibitor : In vivo, there is an enzyme inhibitory mechanism to suppress feedback, but unlike the inhibitor, the reaction is reversible

> ① Irreversible inhibition

>> ○ Example 1. Penicillin-A bacterium cell wall (peptidoglycan) transpeptidase inhibitor, potent because it has a semi-permanent covalent bond with the active site

>> ○ Example 2. Sarin Gas

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Irreversibly binds to the active site of acetylcholine esterase

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Acetylcholine 

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Muscle spasms, pupil shrinkage, delirium, dyspnea

> ② Reversible inhibition : Competitive inhibition, anti-competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition

> ③ Competitive inhibition

>> ○ Inhibits enzymatic reactions by competitively participating in enzymatic reactions over active sites such as substrates

>> ○ Michaelis-Menten Equation (Reference⑹)

>> ○ Does not alter the form of the active enzyme

>> ○ Example : Ibuprofen, statin-HMG-CoA reductase, Ras phosphorylation of Gleevec-Bcl-abr, other antidepressants, antibiotics, insecticides, HIV protease

>>> ○ Reference. Ibuprofen : Inhibiting Prostaglandin Production

>> ○ Example : Malonic Acid-Succinate Dehydrogenase : Succinic dehydrogenase oxidizes succinic acid, which inhibits the oxidation of succinic acid when malonic acid, a competitive inhibitor of succinic acid, binds to the active site of succinic acid dehydrogenase

> ④ Anticompetitive inhibition

>> ○ Inhibitor binds to enzyme-substrate complex and inhibits enzymatic reaction

>> ○ Michaelis-Menten Equation (Reference⑹)

> ⑤ Noncompetitive inhibitors

>> ○ Inhibits the enzymatic reaction by binding to an allosteric site other than the active site, resulting in uncompetitive participation in the enzymatic reaction.

>> ○ Michaelis-Menten Equation (Reference⑹)

>> ○ Changes the form of active enzymes

⑻ Cooperative : Substrates already bound in the substrate enzyme to aid in the binding of other substrates  

> Reference. There is also voice cooperation but extremely rare

> ① Scheme : If there is co-operation, ESn is generated immediately after ES1 is generated, so it is not necessary to consider ES1, ···, ESn-1

> ② Example : Oxygen Saturation of Hemoglobin

⑼ Enzyme Control Mechanism

> ① Control by suppressor (see. ⑹)

> ② Allosteric control (allosteric control)

>> ○ A substrate is bound to an allosteric site of an enzyme to reduce the affinity of the enzyme

>> ○ Does not completely block the reaction like an inhibitor

>> ○ Allosteric regulation occurs in enzymes involved in irreversible reactions

>> ○ Graph form

>>> ○ PFK-1 is an enzyme involved in the production of F-6 as F-1,6-bisphosphate

>>> ○ Because ATP is a substrate of PFK-1, PFK-1 is allosteric controlled by ATP

>>> ○ Graphs with ATP amount on the x-axis and PFK-1 activity on the y-axis show bell-shaped graphs

>> ○ A representative example : Cooperative

> ③ Phosphate Control

> ④ Regulatory proteins
