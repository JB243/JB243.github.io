>> ○ Exothermic reaction: ΔH < 0, related to catabolism.

>> ○ Endothermic reaction: ΔH > 0, related to anabolism.

> ③ Even if a reaction is spontaneous, the reaction rate can be slow if the activation energy (threshold energy) is too high.

> ④ Activation energy

>> ○ Definition: Minimum energy required for reaction molecules to trigger chemical reactions.

>> ○ Lower activation energy increases the reaction rate by increasing the number of molecules that can react.

>> ○ Lock and key model: A model suggesting that the enzyme's active site perfectly matches the substrate.

>> ○ Induced Fit Model: A model suggesting that when an enzyme binds to a substrate, it changes into a completely complementary shape to fit the substrate.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The shape of the substrate is roughly similar to the enzyme's active site.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. When the substrate binds to the active site, the enzyme changes shape and applies pressure on the chemical bonds.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. This shape change breaks down the substrate and releases its monomers.

>> ○ Isozyme (enzyme multiplicity)

>>> ○ Different enzymes involved in the same biochemical reaction.

>>> ○ Have different characteristics depending on the cell that acts (e.g., hexokinase, lactose dehydrogenase (LDH))

>>> ○ Each enzyme is regulated by feedback from its specific end product, resulting in different enzymes being active depending on the type of end product.

⑷ Factors affecting the action of enzymes

> ① **Factor 1.** Substrate concentration

>> ○ Related to Michaelis-Menten equation

>> ○ Initial reaction rate increases with increasing substrate concentration and then becomes constant after reaching a certain level.

>> ○ Once all the enzymes are saturated with the substrate, the initial reaction rate no longer increases with increasing substrate concentration.

> ② **Factor 2.** Temperature

>> ○ As temperature increases, the number of molecules with kinetic energy above the activation energy increases, increasing the reaction rate.

>> ○ The chemical reaction involving enzymes is the fastest at the optimum temperature at which the enzyme has the optimum structure.

>> ○ If the temperature exceeds the optimal level, the protein undergoes irreversible denaturation due to heat and cannot recover even if the temperature is reduced.

> ③ **Factor 3.** pH

>> ○ The chemical reaction involving enzymes is the fastest at the optimum pH.

>> ○ The charged state of the amino acid residues that make up the enzyme depends on the change in the concentration of hydrogen ions, so if it is out of optimum pH, it changes the net charge of the protein, causing electrostatic repulsion and altering the structure of the enzyme.

>> ○ Examples of optimum pH

>>> ○ Pepsin: pH = 1.5

>>> ○ Catalace: pH = 7.6

>>> ○ Trypsin: pH = 7.7

>>> ○ Fumarase: pH = 7.8

⑻ Cooperative : Substrates already bound in the substrate enzyme to aid in the binding of other substrates  

> Reference. There is also voice cooperation but extremely rare

> ① Scheme : If there is co-operation, ESn is generated immediately after ES1 is generated, so it is not necessary to consider ES1, ···, ESn-1

> ② Example : Oxygen Saturation of Hemoglobin

⑼ Enzyme Control Mechanism

> ① Control by suppressor (see. ⑹)

> ② Allosteric control (allosteric control)

>> ○ A substrate is bound to an allosteric site of an enzyme to reduce the affinity of the enzyme

>> ○ Does not completely block the reaction like an inhibitor

>> ○ Allosteric regulation occurs in enzymes involved in irreversible reactions

>> ○ Graph form

>>> ○ PFK-1 is an enzyme involved in the production of F-6 as F-1,6-bisphosphate

>>> ○ Because ATP is a substrate of PFK-1, PFK-1 is allosteric controlled by ATP

>>> ○ Graphs with ATP amount on the x-axis and PFK-1 activity on the y-axis show bell-shaped graphs

>> ○ A representative example : Cooperative

> ③ Phosphate Control

> ④ Regulatory proteins

>> ○ Example : NO synthase regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>\-Calmodulin

⑽ Enzyme immobilization : Immobilizing enzymes in specific positions

> ① Entrapment (encapsulation) : Most widely used as physical enzyme immobilization method

>> ○ porous hollow fiber

>> ○ spun fiber

>> ○ gel matrix

>> ○ micro-capsule

> ② Combination : Chemical enzyme immobilization method, functional groups on the surface of carrier and period of action of enzyme

> ③ effective factor = reaction rate with diffusion limitation / reaction rate without diffusion limitation

>> ○ How much better the reaction rate was by immobilizing the enzyme  

>> ○ Enzyme concentration → effective factor ↓ (meaning that the reaction occurs well because the concentration is high regardless of fixation) 

⑽ Enzyme Assay

>> ○ 680 nm, 700 nm spectrometer : Chlorophyll Absorbance Measurement

>> ○ 840 nm, 870 nm spectromter : Photosynthetic bacteria : Absorption Measurement of Pigment Molecules

> ② Bradford method : Determination of the change in wavelength caused by Coomassie Blue G dye binding to protein

>> ○ Advantages : Fast and simple dosing time

>> ○ Disadvantages : Interference caused by other substances, and the degree of binding of dyes to proteins varies

> ③ Lowry method : Measurement based on reduction of copper ions by amide bonds in amino acids

>> ○ Advantages : Little difference between proteins

>> ○ Disadvantages : Preparation reagent, procedure complexity, interference by other substances
