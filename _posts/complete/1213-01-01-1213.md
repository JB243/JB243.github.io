## **1. Overview**

⑴ Introduction

> ① [AlphaGeometry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5): A language model submitted to a Nature publication that implements symbolic deduction, capable of solving geometry problems at the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

> ② Developed by Google DeepMind, it appears to be an advancement of the hypothesis-generating model [FunSearch](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/Mathematical-discoveries-from-program-search-with-large-language-models.pdf). ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2379))

⑵ Principle

> ① Meaning of a symbol: The process of vectorizing each proposition and placing it on an embedding space.

> ② Symbolic deduction in geometry: Similar to "Euclid's Elements," it starts with axioms about lines, constructions, and concentric circles, leading to the creation of new propositions.

> ③ When given the conditions of a problem, it continuously searches for new true propositions within the search space to prove the given propositions.

> ④ This process can be likened to how a person might ponder a math problem for a long time before finally discovering the solution.

> ⑤ More specifically, 1) it represents the given geometry problem as points, lines, and surfaces, 2) creates a graph data structure, and then 3) operates by connecting the graph data structure with the theorem set.

>> ○ In that case, is it possible to represent medical data as a graph data structure, connect it with clinical information, and implement a logical inference model? (`[The Present and Future of the Bio Industry](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2411)`)

⑶ Process

> ① AlphaGeometry primarily solves problems through angle chasing.

>> ○ Many geometry problems can be solved by angle chasing. For example, the proposition that four points lie on a circle (cyclic proposition) is equivalent to the condition that the circumferential angles of two triangles sharing the same base are equal.

> ② **Step 1.** DD+AR: Repeated use of cyclic quadrilaterals and similar triangles in geometry, more akin to classical algorithms than to AI ([ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/19fg9rx/some_perspective_on_alphageometry/?onetap_auto=true&one_tap=true)).

> ③ **Step 2.** AlphaGeometry mode: Adds new points randomly and then performs DD+AR, using an LLM-based approach.

>> ○ The addition of new points is a heuristic process in humans, now made possible creatively with the advent of transformer-based LLMs.

⑷ Limitations

> ① **Limitation 1.** While geometric problems are based on definitive propositions leading to logical conclusions, real-world problems often depend on indeterminate propositions for decision-making.

> ② **Limitation 2.** Geometric problems often involve equivalence issues, whereas real-world decision-making frequently involves comparative issues.

>> ○ Example of equivalence issue: Being on the same circle, M is the midpoint of A and B, etc.

>> ○ Example of comparative issue: Will treating a breast cancer patient with Gemcitabine increase survival rates?

>> ○ Can AlphaGeometry, which solves equality problems, solve comparison problems given the intrinsic limitations of triangles?

> ③ **Limitations 3.** Geometric problems deal with bidirectional propositional relationships (where two propositions are necessary and sufficient conditions for each other), but in real-world decision-making, there are many unidirectional propositional relationships.

>> ○ In other words, if A → B holds, then in geometric problems B → A also holds. However, in real-world decision-making, it is often the case that B ⇏ A.

>> ○ Similarly, if A → B holds, then in geometric problems ~A → ~B also holds. However, in real-world decision-making, it is often the case that ~A ⇏ ~B.

⑸ Significance

> ① **Significance 1.** The first model for logical reasoning. (`[AI That Generates Hypotheses: The Beginning of the Idea](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2379)`)

> ② **Significance 2.** Possibility for logical reasoning on a large scale: If solving an IMO problem involves linking dozens of propositions, could humanity connect over a thousand propositions to derive new conclusions through AI? This may be possible through AI, marking a breakthrough in the horizons of cognition. (`[The Horizon of Cognition and the Breakthrough Called AI](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2410)`)

> ③ **Significance 3.** Even if there is an incorrect proposition, it does not affect the final logical reasoning.

## **2. Installation Process**

⑴ Since installing according to [the official documentation](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry) results in an error, I followed the procedure below.  

⑵ **Step 1:** Run the following command on an Ubuntu server. 

> ① In my case, I used `Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-105-generic x86_64)`.

<br>

```python
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
conda create -n alphageometry python=3.10.9
conda activate alphageometry
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry.git
cd alphageometry
```

<br>

⑶ **Step 2:** Install the following packages.  

<br>

```python
pip install array-record==0.4.1 
pip install clu==0.0.7 
pip install seqio==0.0.18 
pip install seqio-nightly==0.0.17.dev20231013 
pip install t5==0.9.4 
pip install tensorflow-datasets==4.9.3 
pip install mesh-tensorflow[transformer]==0.1.21 
pip install tfds-nightly==4.9.2.dev202308090034
pip install matplotlib
```

<br>

⑷ **Step 3:** Replace `run.sh` in the corresponding directory with [the following file](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/uKsVB/btsIQ0w0cZh/CwBJfosgcIk0cQQKe4Q110/run.sh?attach=1&knm=tfile.sh) ([ref](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry/pull/54/commits/3debb824a1c199c789fb8d4f562dc1319ac9c6c8)).  

> ① **Note:** The original paper uses `BATCH_SIZE=32`, `BEAM_SIZE=512`, and `DEPTH=16`, so these values are reflected.  

⑸ **Step 4:** Properly comment out `matplotlib.use('TkAgg')` and the `draw` function in `numericas.py`.  

> ① **Reason:** Since the script is running on a headless server without a GUI, executing a drawing function related to `matplotlib` results in the following error:

<br>

```bash
ImportError: Cannot load backend 'TkAgg' which requires the 'tk' interactive framework, as 'headless' is currently running
```  

<br>

⑹ **Step 5:** Run the following command:  

<br>

```bash
bash run.sh
```  

<br>

⑺ Run AlphaGeometry in `ddar` mode: Replace the example in the `run.sh` file with the code below and reinstall.  

<br>

```python
python -m alphageometry \
--alsologtostderr \
--problems_file=$(pwd)/imo_ag_30.txt \
--problem_name=translated_imo_2000_p1 \
--mode=ddar \
"./defs.txt"
```

<br>

⑻ Run AlphaGeometry in `alphageometry` mode: Replace the example in the `run.sh` file with the code below and reinstall.  

<br>

```python
python -m alphageometry \
--alsologtostderr \
--problems_file=$(pwd)/imo_ag_30.txt \
--problem_name=translated_imo_2000_p6 \
--mode=alphageometry \
"./defs.txt" \
"${SEARCH_ARGS[@]}" \
"${LM_ARGS[@]}"
```
