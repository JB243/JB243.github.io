## **1. Overview**

Here's the translation:

⑴ Principle

> ① [AlphaGeometry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5): A language model submitted to a Nature publication that implements symbolic deduction, capable of solving geometry problems at the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

> ② Developed by Google DeepMind, it appears to be an advancement of the hypothesis-generating model [FunSearch](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/Mathematical-discoveries-from-program-search-with-large-language-models.pdf) ([ref](https://nate9389.tistory.com/2379)).

> ③ Meaning of a symbol: The process of vectorizing each proposition and placing it on an embedding space.

> ④ Symbolic deduction in geometry: Similar to "Euclid's Elements," it starts with axioms about lines, constructions, and concentric circles, leading to the creation of new propositions.

> ⑤ When given the conditions of a problem, it continuously searches for new true propositions within the search space to prove the given propositions.

> ⑥ This process can be likened to how a person might ponder a math problem for a long time before finally discovering the solution.

⑵ Process

> ① AlphaGeometry primarily solves problems through angle chasing.

> ② **Step 1.** DD+AR: Repeated use of cyclic quadrilaterals and similar triangles in geometry, more akin to classical algorithms than to AI (ref).

> ③ **Step 2.** AlphaGeometry mode: Adds new points randomly and then performs DD+AR, using an LLM-based approach.

>> ○ The addition of new points is a heuristic process in humans, now made possible creatively with the advent of transformer-based LLMs.

⑶ Limitations

> ① **Limitation 1.** While geometric problems are based on definitive propositions leading to logical conclusions, real-world problems often depend on indeterminate propositions for decision-making.

> ② **Limitation 2.** Geometric problems often involve equivalence issues, whereas real-world decision-making frequently involves comparative issues.

>> ○ Example of equivalence issue: Being on the same circle, M is the midpoint of A and B, etc.

>> ○ Example of comparative issue: Will treating a breast cancer patient with Gemcitabine increase survival rates?

⑷ Significance

> ① **Significance 1.** The first model for logical reasoning.

> ② **Significance 2.** Possibility for logical reasoning on a large scale: If solving an IMO problem involves linking dozens of propositions, could humanity connect over a thousand propositions to derive new conclusions through AI? This may be possible through AI, marking a breakthrough in the horizons of cognition. ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2410))

## **2. Installation Process**

⑴ The procedure in the [official documentation](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry) causes errors, so follow these steps instead.

⑵ **Step 1.** Execute the following on an Ubuntu server: The author uses Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-105-generic x86_64).

<br>

```python
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
conda create -n alphageometry python=3.10.9
conda activate alphageometry
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry.git
cd alphageometry
pip install array-record==0.4.1
pip install clu==0.0.7
pip install seqio==0.0.18
pip install seqio-nightly==0.0.17.dev20231013 
pip install t5==0.9.4
pip install tensorflow-datasets==4.9.3
pip install mesh-tensorflow[transformer]==0.1.21
pip install tfds-nightly==4.9.2.dev202308090034
```

<br>

⑶ **Step 2.** Remove the following installation items from requirements.txt:

> ① array-record  

> ② clu  

> ③ seqio  

> ④ seqio-nightly  

> ⑤ t5  

> ⑥ tensorflow-datasets  

> ⑦ mesh-tensorflow[transformer]  

> ⑧ tfds-nightly

⑷ **Step 3.** `bash run.sh`: Although this code line skips much of steps 1 and 2, it causes package errors.

> ① An error occurs at `gdown --folder https://bit.ly/alphageometry` when executing the code.

⑸ **Step 4.** Download checkpoint files from the following links and place them in the `ag_ckpt_vocab` folder:

> ① <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qXkmmgoJ8oTYJdFV1xw0xGPpQj6SyOYA>  

> ② <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1t-r3KfU8aDbS1UHpdyM3LH21rwSCIXTz>  

> ③ <https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mRd6J0UkeWoFUjeVB7BQi5lVNLvPBe31>

⑹ **Step 5.** Execute the remaining code that could not be run in `bash run.sh`.

<br>

```python
MELIAD_PATH=meliad_lib/meliad
mkdir -p $MELIAD_PATH
git clone https://github.com/google-research/meliad $MELIAD_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$MELIAD_PATH

DDAR_ARGS=(
  --defs_file=$(pwd)/defs.txt \
  --rules_file=$(pwd)/rules.txt \
);

BATCH_SIZE=2
BEAM_SIZE=2
DEPTH=2

SEARCH_ARGS=(
  --beam_size=$BEAM_SIZE
  --search_depth=$DEPTH
)

LM_ARGS=(
  --ckpt_path=$DATA \
  --vocab_path=$DATA/geometry.757.model \
  --gin_search_paths=$MELIAD_PATH/transformer/configs \
  --gin_file=base_htrans.gin \
  --gin_file=size/medium_150M.gin \
  --gin_file=options/positions_t5.gin \
  --gin_file=options/lr_cosine_decay.gin \
  --gin_file=options/seq_1024_nocache.gin \
  --gin_file=geometry_150M_generate.gin \
  --gin_param=DecoderOnlyLanguageModelGenerate.output_token_losses=True \
  --gin_param=TransformerTaskConfig.batch_size=$BATCH_SIZE \
  --gin_param=TransformerTaskConfig.sequence_length=128 \
  --gin_param=Trainer.restore_state_variables=False
);

echo $PYTHONPATH
```

<br>

⑺ **Step 6.** Installation is complete, but some errors remain, requiring the installation of additional packages.

<br>

```python
pip install matplotlib

sudo apt-get install xvfb
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &
export DISPLAY=:1.0

pip uninstall flax jax jaxlib
pip install flax==0.5.3 jax==0.4.6 jaxlib==0.4.6
```

<br>

⑻ **Step 7.** AlphaGeometry can now be executed in ddar mode.

<br>

```python
python -m alphageometry \
--alsologtostderr \
--problems_file=$(pwd)/imo_ag_30.txt \
--problem_name=translated_imo_2000_p1 \
--mode=ddar \
"./defs.txt"
```

<br>

⑼ **Step 8.** To run in alphageometry mode, move the following `.gin` files to `./`:

> ① Move `./meliad_lib/meliad/transformer/configs/base_htrans.gin` to `./`.  

> ② Move `./meliad_lib/meliad/transformer/configs/memory_configuration.gin` to `./`.  

> ③ Move `./meliad_lib/meliad/transformer/configs/trainer_configuration.gin` to `./`.

⑽ **Step 9.** AlphaGeometry can now be executed in alphageometry mode.

<br>

```python
python -m alphageometry \
--alsologtostderr \
--problems_file=$(pwd)/imo_ag_30.txt \
--problem_name=translated_imo_2000_p6 \
--mode=alphageometry \
"./defs.txt" \
"${SEARCH_ARGS[@]}" \
"${LM_ARGS[@]}"
```

<br>

> ① Currently unable to execute due to `TypeError: JAX only supports number and bool dtypes, got dtype bfloat16 in astype` error.

<br>
