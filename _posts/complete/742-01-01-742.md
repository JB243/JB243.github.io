## **1.** History of Light

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Wave Theory: Light is described as a wave.

> ② Corpuscular Theory: Light is described as particles.

> ③ The history of light research can be seen as the history of determining whether light is a wave or a particle.

 ⑵ History up to Modern Times

> ① Aristotle (BC. 384-322): When we see something in the world, what comes out of our eyes is something that is reflected from objects.

> ② Hasan Ibn al Haytham (965-1040): Claimed similarities between the anatomy of the eye and the pinhole camera.

> ③ Francesco Maria Grimaldi (Bologna): Explained diffraction of light as particle theory in 1660.

> ④ Huygens: Advocated the wave theory of light. Effectively explained reflection and refraction.

>> ○ _Treatise on light_ (1690)

>> ○ Thought light is waves that move through a medium called "aether."

> ⑤ Newton: Claimed light consists of particles called corpuscles.

>> ○ _Opticks_ (1704)

> ⑥ Diffraction Experiment

> ⑦ Scattering Experiment

> ⑧ Thomas Young (1773-1829)

>> ○ Double-slit interference experiment (1801-1803)

>> ○ Measurement of light wavelengths

> ⑨ Augustine Fresnel (1788-1827)

>> ○ Advocated the wave nature of light

>> ○ Developed methodology for diffraction from Huygens' principles (1818)

> ⑩ James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879)

>> ○ Formulated mathematical theories of electricity and magnetism into 4 Maxwell's equations

>> ○ Presented a theory of electromagnetic wave propagation (1873)

>> ○ Calculated the speed of electromagnetic waves and found it equal to the speed of light

> ⑪ Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894): Produced and detected electromagnetic waves predicted by Maxwell (1887)

 ⑶ Photoelectric Effect: Adopted as evidence for the particle nature of light through Einstein's interpretation.

> ① Overview

>> ○ Definition: Phenomenon where incident light collides with a metal plate, emitting photoelectrons.

>> ○ Work Function: Minimum energy required for the photoelectric effect, equivalent to ionization energy.

>> ○ Threshold Frequency: Minimum frequency of light for the photoelectric effect. h × threshold frequency = work function.

>> ○ Maximum Kinetic Energy of Photons: Incident light energy - work function

> ② Interaction between Matter and Light

**Figure 2.** Energy levels and the photoelectric effect.

>> ○ X = a, Y = b, Z = c

>> ○ No photoelectrons are emitted when X and Z are illuminated separately. Photoelectrons are emitted when Y is illuminated.

>> ○ Energy of photon Y is equal to the sum of energies of photons X and Z.

>> ○ No photoelectrons are emitted when X and Z are illuminated simultaneously at point P.

>> ○ Reason: A photon interacting with a single atom can only interact once.

> ③ Applications

>> ○ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)

 ⑷ [Blackbody Radiation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/750)

> ① Definition: Phenomenon where all objects with energy emit light.

> ② Blackbody: An object that absorbs all incident energy and emits all absorbed energy.

> ③ **Number of Wave Modes**

>> ○ Based on [Steady Waves](https://jb243.github.io/pages/740), assigned according to direction.

>> ○ 1D Steady Waves: Depending on state number n (natural number), various steady waves of different frequencies exist for length L.

>> ○ 3D Steady Waves: Various waves (in this case, light) exist depending on the state vector (l, m, n) of the wave.

>> ○ State vectors can be correlated to orthogonal coordinates: Consider 1/8 octant due to positive integers l, m, n.

>> ○ Number of wave modes: For a distance from origin p and radius p within 1/8 octant lattice points, N*(p),

>> ○ Relationship between mode number (N*) and frequency (ν)

>> ○ The formula does not account for the possibility of two waves with the same state number but opposite phases.

>> ○ Conclusion: For volume V = L^3, with state number per unit volume N = N* / V,

> ④ **Rayleigh-Jeans Law**

>> ○ Overview: To analyze blackbody radiation as waves, ultraviolet catastrophe should be observed.

>> ○ Thermodynamics: Average vibrational energy in addition to translational and rotational motion, assigned a degree of freedom of 2.

>> ○ Average radiant energy per unit volume at frequency ν

>> ○ **Ultraviolet Catastrophe** (UV catastrophe): Blackbody radiates infinitely close light with wavelengths near 0.

>> ○ In reality, light with wavelengths near 0 converges to zero intensity.

> ⑤ **Planck's Law**

>> ○ Max Planck introduced particles and assumed E = hν to successfully explain it in 1900.

>> ○ Energy of a single photon

>> ○ Probability of having n photons with frequency ν: Probability of particles with a specific energy follows [Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1338)).

>> ○ Average energy of the system

>> ○ Average radiant energy per unit volume at frequency ν

**Figure 3.** Planck's curve.

>> ○ Total energy per unit volume of the system

>> ○ Photon flux

> ⑥ **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: Energy emitted by a unit area per unit time by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of the blackbody's absolute temperature T(K).

>> ○ Real objects sometimes account for reflectivity ε in the equation

>> ○ σ: Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 8.22 × 10^-11

> ⑦ **Wien's Displacement Law**: Wavelength λmax (µm) at which maximum radiative energy is emitted is inversely proportional to the blackbody's absolute temperature T(K).

>> ○ α: Wien's constant, 2.89 × 10^3

> ⑧ **Pauli Exclusion Principle**

>> ○ Definition: No two quantum numbers for an electron in the same orbit can be identical.

>> ○ Why Planck's curve appears as a continuous graph

>> ○ As atoms aggregate, energy levels slightly shift, and energy levels appear continuously.

 ⑸ **Compton Scattering**

> ① Phenomenon where light is incident on a stationary electron, and photon and electron undergo elastic collision.

> ② Evidence of the particle nature of light

> ③ [Experimental Design](https://jb243.github.io/pages/756)

 ⑹ Wave Nature of Electrons

> ① Davisson-Germer Experiment: Demonstrated diffraction when electron beam is incident on a nickel crystal.

> ② Thomson's Electron Scattering Experiment (1925)

>> ○ Obtained electron diffraction pattern similar to X-ray diffraction by illuminating electron beam onto metal foil

>> ○ Conclusion: Experimentally demonstrated that electrons, conventionally known as particles, can undergo diffraction.

>> ○ Inference: If electrons have wave-like properties, their precise orbits cannot be determined.
