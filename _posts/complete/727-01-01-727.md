## **2. Types of Forces**

 ⑴ Type 1 **:** External Force

> Force applied from outside. There are exactly four types of forces in physics

 ⑵ Type 1-1 **:** Universal Gravitation

> ① Universal Gravitation **:** Force between two objects with mass

Note: r **:** distance between objects, G **:** universal gravitational constant, 6.67 × 10-11 m3/s2·kg

>> ○ Universal gravitation is interactive **:** If force is proportional to mass, it's proportional to the product of masses

>> ○ Universal gravitation inversely proportional to distance squared **:** Due to flux of gravitational field, which follows the inverse square law of distance

>> ○ Distance dependence of universal gravitation assessed through analysis of celestial motion

>> ○ Mass in universal gravitation referred to as gravitational mass **:** Unlike inertial mass, source of force

> ② Gravity

>> ○ Gravity **:** The universal gravitation on Earth's surface (r = 6370 km, M = 5.98 × 1024 kg)

>> ○ Mass and weight

>>> ○ **Mass** **:** Inherent quantity of an object, constant regardless of location

>>> ○ **Weight** **:** Force due to mass, varies with location

>> ○ Weightless state **:** State where net force is 0 (e.g., elevator in free fall)

>> ○ Small-scale Earth movement has relatively constant gravity due to nearly constant object-Earth distance **:** g = 9.81 m/s2

> ③ [Buoyancy](https://jb243.github.io/pages/933#footnote_link_67_54) **:** Force resulting from combination of gravity and Pascal's principle

>> ○ Buoyancy **:** Force on an object submerged in a fluid, tends to make it rise

>> ○ Magnitude of buoyancy **:** Equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the object

> ④ Vertical Force (Normal Force) **:** Essentially elastic force due to compression

>> ○ All objects can be compressed like a spring. Hook's law holds for all objects like for a spring

>> ○ Vertical force only acts along the length of a bar

> ⑤ Tension

>> ○ Definition **:** Force pulling adjacent parts of a string towards each other

>> ○ **Characteristic 1:** External force acts in the direction of pulling the ends of the string **:** Tension only pulls the ends of the object

>> ○ **Characteristic 2:** Tension on objects at both ends is the same

>> ○ Tension participates in creating conditions for maximum and minimum in [Mechanical Equilibrium](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1913)
  
> ⑥ Friction Force **:** Force arising from vertical force that hinders object's motion

>> f = μN

>> ○ Friction proportional to vertical force

**Figure 1.** Reason why friction is proportional to vertical force

>>> ○ **Case 1:** Object's shape remains constant

>>>> ○ If vertical force doubles, object compresses twice as much

>>>> ○ Deeper compression increases the contact area with the concave floor surface

>>>> ○ In stationary object, friction proportional to the contact area hinders motion

>>>> ○ In moving object, object has to push against surface in proportion to the contact area

>>> ○ **Case 2:** Object's width doubles

>>>> ○ If vertical force remains constant, compressed height is halved

>>>> ○ Reason **:** Surface area doubled, stress halves

>>>> ○ Surface area doubled, compressed height halved, so contact area with floor remains unchanged

>>>> ○ Conclusion **:** Object's shape doesn't affect vertical force

>>> ○ Limits of this thought experiment

>>>> ○ **Limit 1:** Neglects consideration of the object's contact with the floor **:** Considers only the object's side

>>>> ○ **Limit 2:** Applies Hooke's law as an approximation for the floor **:** Doesn't consider floor as a separate object

>>>> ○ The proportionality of friction to vertical force is an approximate conclusion.

>> ○ **Type 1.** **Static Friction** **:** The friction when an object is at rest.

>>> ○ The net force on a stationary object is 0, so it is in equilibrium with external forces.

>>> ○ c **:** Coefficient of rolling resistance.

>>> ○ The minimum conditions for the object to roll and zero net torque are intuitively equivalent.
○ Generally, if the surface is rigid (not deformable), c = 0 and rolling friction does not occur.

>>> ○ **Application 1.** Slip ratio **:** 1 - (Actual distance moved by the center of mass in one rotation of the sphere) / (Distance moved by the center of mass in one rotation of the sphere when no slipping occurs)

>>>> ○ Slip ratio is important in discussions of car wheels.

>>>> ○ Relationship between friction and slip ratio.

**Figure 3.** Relationship between friction and slip ratio.

>>>> ○ Friction is strongest when the slip ratio is between 10-15%.

>>>> ○ When the slip ratio is 0, only static friction is present, similar to rotational motion of a rigid body.

>>>> ○ From slip ratio 0 to maximum friction, static friction is dominant. Beyond that, kinetic friction becomes dominant.
