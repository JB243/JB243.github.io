<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/e3126c45-6bb6-4a9c-99ff-920b72728118)

>> ○ Source **:** Application and Solution of Transport Phenomena, Transport Phenomena Division Committee (Hyun-Gu Lee), Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, 2002, p. 14

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/8ab58bed-2434-427c-8fbc-d3a8b2cd9164)

<br>

> is given. Here, μ0 represents the viscosity of pure water. Therefore, as Φ increases, the effective viscosity μ of the solution increases, and the settling velocity of particles in the colloidal solution decreases. Therefore, when Φ1 > Φ2, the particles with smaller volume fraction Φ2 will precipitate first. Also, as the particle concentration increases, the settling velocity is also reduced due to the hindering effect caused by interactions between particles.

## **5. Buoyancy**

 ⑴ Definition: Force exerted by a fluid on an object submerged in it, opposite to the object's gravity

 ⑵ Magnitude

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/5ba1265e-c584-416a-b23a-b39c2499f25c)

<br>

 ⑶ Induction

> ① Sum of pressures exerted on the front, back, left, and right of an object within a gravitational field is zero

> ② The pressure below is greater than above in a gravitational field → a force lifts the object from below

> ③ Rigorous mathematical proof: Utilization of Divergence Theorem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/a47cfe0e-b25e-4dde-816c-c66fb85eddf2)

<br>

 ⑷ Archimedes' Principle

> ① Alternative expressions of buoyancy

> ② **Expression 1:** A submerged object experiences buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced

> ③ **Expression 2:** Buoyant force in a vessel filled with fluid equals the weight of the displaced fluid

> ④ Interpretation:

>> ○ Volume of pure gold and fake gold remains constant → Buoyant force on pure gold equals that on fake gold

>> ○ Since the density of pure gold is greater than that of fake gold, gravity is stronger on pure gold

>> ○ Net gravity is greater on pure gold → When placed in water, an equilibrium balance tilts toward the pure gold side

<br>

## **6. Surface Tension**

⑴ Definition: Force that tends to minimize the surface area of a liquid due to intermolecular forces

> ① Reason for the spherical shape of water droplets

> ② Stronger intermolecular forces result in stronger cohesion, especially in substances like water that engage in hydrogen bonding

⑵ Simple Understanding

> ② Molecules on the surface experience a net inward force

 ⑶ Complex Understanding

> ① Surface has higher potential energy than the interior

> ② Molecules strive to minimize their presence on the surface

> ③ This results in a force trying to reduce the surface area

 ⑷ Laplace-Young Equation: Describes the magnitude of surface tension

**Figure. 3.** Expansion of a liquid film and surface tension

<br>

> The size of the liquid film is exaggerated.

> Particles 2 and 3 in equilibrium do not exert resistance.

> However, particle 1 experiences a net force in the ← direction.

> Because other liquids try to pull it down. (Indicated by V)

> Connecting particles 1 forms a line, so surface tension is proportional to length, not area.

> F = 2 × b × σ<sub>s</sub> + F<sub>friction, motion</sub>. (Where width is ignored.)

> The coefficient 2 arises from having two sides of the film, thus two edges.

> ① Definition: A fluid whose viscosity decreases with increasing stress. n < 1

> ② Also known as shear-thinning fluid.

<br>

>> ○ τ<sub>0</sub> **:** Yield stress required to initiate flow (Pa)

> ② Also known as ideal plastic fluid.

> ③ Qualitative description:

>> ○ Bingham fluid refers to fluids with considerable yield stress τ0.

>> ○ For conduit flow, if τwall < τ0, the fluid cannot flow due to static equilibrium of forces.

>> ○ For conduit flow, if τwall ≥ τ0, the fluid flows naturally due to dynamic equilibrium of pressure gradient and shear stress.
