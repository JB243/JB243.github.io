## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ A method to test whether continuous measurement values having **two values appear randomly without any pattern or trend**

 ⑵ A run refers to a cluster starting and ending with the same measurement values

> ① Example **:** In a sequence like 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, there are a total of 7 runs as 1/00/1/0/111/0/1

<br>

<br>

## **2. Assumptions**

 ⑴ If the data is not binary, it should be converted to binary

 ⑵ Binarize using a criterion such as mean, median, mode, or a number defined by the user

<br>

<br>

## **3. Procedure**

 ⑴ **Step 1.** Hypothesis Testing

> ① Null Hypothesis H0 **:** Continuous measurement values are random

> ② Alternative Hypothesis H1 **:** Continuous measurement values are not random

 ⑵ **Step 2.** Calculate Test Statistic

 ⑶ **Step 3.** Test Rejection Region

> ① If the p-value of z is less than (including equal to) the lower rejection region or greater than the upper rejection region, reject the null hypothesis
