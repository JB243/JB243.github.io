 ⑵ Aristotle's Model

## **3. Einstein's Cosmology: Asserting a Stationary Universe**

 ⑴ General Theory of Relativity

> ① Overview: Curvature of spacetime is determined by energy-matter distribution, and objects move along geodesics

> ② **Key Concept 1:** Einstein's field equations (cosmic equations)

> ② Nearby and distant galaxies

>> ○ Nearby galaxies are bluish

>> ○ Distant galaxies are consistently redshifted

> ③ Galaxy's redshift velocity ∝ distance

>> ○ **Redshift formula:** Speed of light c, original absorption wavelength λ0, change in wavelength of absorption line Δλ,

>>> v = c Δλ / λ0

>> ○ Hubble constant: 50 kms-1Mpc-1

>>> v = H × r (where r is distance)

## **6. Big Bang Theory**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Theory proposing that the universe originated from an extremely hot, dense point in a Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago

> ② (Note) The idea of the Big Bang originated from reversing time in Hubble's expanding universe theory

> ③ Before the Big Bang, the concept of time did not exist.

 ⑵ 1<sup>st</sup>. Generation of Basic Particles

> ① Basic particles like quarks and electrons are generated as the temperature of the universe rapidly decreases.

 ⑶ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Generation of Protons and Neutrons

> ① Three quarks combine to form protons and neutrons.

> ② The ratio of protons to neutrons changes from about 1:1 initially to about 7:1.

> ③ Neutrons convert to protons through a nuclear reaction due to the stability difference.

 ⑷ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Around 3 Minutes After the Big Bang

> ① With the universe's temperature at about 1 billion K, two protons and two neutrons combine to form helium nuclei.

> ② Among 16 nuclei, 14 are protons and 2 are neutrons.

> ③ 12 protons form 12 hydrogen nuclei, while 2 protons and 2 neutrons form 1 helium nucleus.

 ⑸ 4<sup>th</sup>. Around 380,000 Years After the Big Bang

> ① As the universe's temperature drops to about 3000 K, atomic nuclei and electrons combine.

> ② Hydrogen and helium atoms are formed.

> ③ Transition from opaque universe to transparent universe:

>> ○ Opaque Universe: Light collides with free-roaming electrons, becoming trapped.

>> ○ Transparent Universe: Light can travel straight due to electrons being bound to atomic nuclei, making space transparent.

> ④ Photons escape the plasma state and propagate through space as cosmic microwave background radiation.

 ⑹ **Evidence 1.** Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

**Figure. 4.** Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation observed by the WMAP Satellite

> ① Definition: Light emitted in the early universe.

> ② When atoms formed at a temperature of 3000 K, light spread throughout the universe.

> ③ The expansion of the universe causes longer wavelengths, observed as radiation energy at about 2.7 K.

>> ○ In the form of microwaves.

>> ○ The value 2.7 K is calculated using Wien's displacement law under the assumption of black body radiation.

> ⑤ Later discovered by Penzias and Wilson in 1965.

 ⑺ **Evidence 2.** Distribution of Elements in the Universe

> ① Ratio of Hydrogen Nuclei to Helium Nuclei = 12:1

> ② Mass of 1 Hydrogen Nucleus : Mass of 1 Helium Nucleus = 1:4

> ③ Mass ratio of all hydrogen nuclei to all helium nuclei = 3:1

> ④ Dark Energy (73%)

>> ○ In a universe with ordinary and dark matter, contraction would prevail.

>> ○ Dark energy is the force driving cosmic expansion.
