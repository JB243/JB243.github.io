## **2. Nitrogenous Wastes**

⑴ Generation of Nitrogenous Wastes

> ① Amino Acid Breakdown **:** Reaction in which amino groups are removed during amino acid metabolism, producing ammonia

>> ○ Liver combines ammonia with CO2 via the ornithine cycle to synthesize urea

>>> ○ Mitochondria and cytoplasm are involved

>>> ○ Urea formation occurs in the cytoplasm

>> ○ Kidneys secrete ammonia into renal tubules

>> ○ Amino Group Transfer Reaction (Glutamine, Asparagine) **:** Reaction transferring amino groups to form 2-oxoacids

**Figure 1.** Ornithine Cycle

<br>

> ② Nucleic Acid Breakdown **:** Production of uric acid

>> ○ Humans lack enzymes for uric acid breakdown

>> ○ 25% excretion via digestive system, 75% excretion via kidneys

>> ○ Accumulation of uric acid can lead to gout and uric acid kidney stones (composed of uric acid, phosphates, calcium, oxalates, etc.)

>> ○ Gout **:** Main causes include genetics, kidney disorders, medications, diabetes, alcohol consumption, etc.

**Figure 2.** Types of Nitrogenous Wastes

<br>

> ① Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>, ammonia)

>> ○ Characteristics **:** High solubility, high toxicity (because ammonia readily accepts H<sup>+</sup> ions)

>> ○ (During excretion) Water requirement **:** 1 mL per 1 g of nitrogen

>> ○ Relevant animals **:** Mostly cartilaginous fish, aquatic invertebrates

> ② Urea

>> ○ Characteristics **:** Much weaker toxicity compared to ammonia (10,000 times), excretable in concentrated form

>> ○ Energy required for urea synthesis

>> ○ (During excretion) Water requirement **:** 1 mL per 50 g of nitrogen

>> ○ Relevant animals **:** Mostly mammals, amphibians, cartilaginous fish, some bony fish

> ③ Uric Acid

## **5. Kidney Functions**

  ⑴ 20-25% of cardiac output (500-600 mL/minute) passes through the afferent arterioles

  ⑵ Filtration, Reabsorption, Secretion, Excretion

> ① Filtration **:** Small molecules (H2O, salts, etc.) are non-selectively filtered in the glomerulus

> ② Reabsorption **:** Tubule cells transport useful substances from the filtrate back to the body fluids

> ③ Secretion **:** Toxic substances and excess ions from body fluids (capillaries) are secreted into the filtrate (tubules)

> ④ Excretion **:** Filtrate leaves the kidneys and is expelled from the body

  ⑶ 1<sup>st</sup>. **Filtration**

> ① Glomerular Filtration Pressure **:** Driving force for filtration

>> ○ Glomerular Filtration Pressure = Glomerular Capillary Pressure (Blood Pressure) - (Bowman's Capsule Osmotic Pressure + Plasma Colloid Osmotic Pressure) = 55 - (30 + 15) = 10 (mmHg)

>> ○ Plasma Colloid Osmotic Pressure **:** Caused by proteins in the blood that pull water back into the blood

>> ○ Bowman's Capsule Osmotic Pressure **:** Counteracts the hydrostatic pressure generated in Bowman's capsule

> ② Difference in blood flow between afferent and efferent arterioles determines filtration rate

>> ○ Afferent arterioles are larger in diameter compared to efferent arterioles

>> ○ Constriction of afferent arterioles **:** Decreases blood flow to glomerular capillaries, reducing glomerular capillary pressure **→** Decreased filtration rate

>> ○ Constriction of efferent arterioles **:** Limits blood outflow, increasing glomerular capillary pressure **→** Increased filtration rate

>> ○ Dilation of afferent arterioles **:** Increases blood flow to glomerular capillaries, raising glomerular capillary pressure **→** Increased filtration rate

>> ○ Dilation of efferent arterioles **:** Facilitates blood outflow, decreasing glomerular capillary pressure **→** Decreased filtration rate

>> ○ Vasoconstriction **:** Increases pressure in the arterial portion, decreases in the venous portion

> ③ Filtration Rate

>> ○ Renal Blood Flow (RBF) (unit: mL/min) **:** Blood flow through renal vessels in 1 minute

>> ○ Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) (unit: mL/min) **:** Plasma flow through renal vessels in 1 minute

>> ○ Renal Threshold **:** Concentration at which a substance starts to be secreted

>> ○ Hematocrit = Blood Hematocrit = Plasma / Blood = RPF / RBF

>> ○ **PAH** **:** Completely removed from plasma

>> ○ **Creatine** **:** Not reabsorbed or secreted in the renal tubules

>>> ○ Produced by breakdown of creatine phosphate in muscles at a fairly constant rate

>>> ○ Cleared by kidneys, frequently used to measure GFR

>>> ○ Used as a safety marker for kidney function

>> ○ **Negative Pressure**: No secretion and reabsorption through the nephron

>> ○ Chart for Filtration Rate Calculation: Calculation of filtration rate can be understood through the principle of mass conservation.

## **7. Renal Disorders** 

⑴ Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)

⑵ Diabetes Insipidus

> ① Central Diabetes Insipidus: Issues with the hypothalamus or pituitary gland → Normal response to ADH administration

> ② Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus: Issues with ADH receptors

⑶ Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

> ① COVID-19 infection can also cause acute kidney injury

> ② Treatment: AMF (amifostine)

⑷ Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

**Table. 4.** Classification of CKD

<br>

⑸ Hypercalcemia

> ① Acidosis, Alkalosis

> ② Hyperaldosteronism: Metabolic alkalosis

> ③ Hypoaldosteronism: Metabolic acidosis

> ④ Hypokalemia → Decreased H<sup>+</sup>

⑹ Renal Transplantation

> ① In renal transplantation, the kidney must be removed, and a new kidney must be transplanted within 48 hours.

<br>

<br>

## **8. Sweat** 

⑴ Functions of Sweat

> ① Temperature regulation: Utilizes the evaporation of sweat to lower elevated body temperature

> ② Edema prevention: Intense exercise → Increased systolic blood pressure → Increased capillary permeability → Edema → Prevention of edema through loss of moisture via sweat

⑵ Sweat glands secrete Ach under the influence of postganglionic nerves.
