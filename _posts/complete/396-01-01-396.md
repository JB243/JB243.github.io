<br>

## **Philosophy**

**1.** [What is knowledge?](https://nate9389.tistory.com/387) 

<br>

**2.** [What is justice?](https://nate9389.tistory.com/2273) 

<br>

**3.** Nature is precisely determined by calculus, and human behavior is finely determined by game theory.

> ⑴ Therefore, the rules of nature are continuous, and the rules of society are discrete.

<br>

**4.** Isn't Goedel's theorem of imperfections not applicable to a three-stage argument that is too obvious? What does Goedel's incomplete theorem prove?

<br>

**5.** Is there a meaning to life?

> ⑴ It may seem rather sacred because it is meaningless.

> ⑵ Nietzsche referred to emotional as Dionysos and rational as Apollon. He said that the purpose of life may be to seek to become more valuable by building intelligence (Apollon), or to explore a wider fantasy world through free imagination (Dionysos). 

<br>

**6.** Art needs to be more stubbornly artistic.

<br>

<br>

## **Self-development**

**7.** A person lives to realize his or her self. 

> ⑴ People realize what they are good at by comparing themselves to others and establishing themselves.

<br>

**8.** Being overproud is being overscarce.

<br>

**9.** A pessimist criticizes why there are no facts to criticize if there are no more facts to criticize.

> ⑴ Similarly, a pessimist criticizes a perfect person for lack of humanity.

> ⑵ Visioner and critical are not compatible.

<br>

**10.** The development of a person is also an example of punctuated equilibrium. It is called 'motive'.

<br>

<br>

**11.** Human growth is so great that it can even change causality or go against nature's providence.

<br>

**12.** Picasso is said to have already completed the painting level at the age of five. But isn't it that he's interested in Cubism that the well-drawn masterpieces are too obvious and there's no new area to try?

<br>

**13.** By entropy, this world is not a good environment to bear lives. I think greed in people is the strength to survive and the motive to develop in this uncompromising world. So greed is not necessarily bad.

> ⑴ Love changes easily, but greed doesn't change. Therefore, you must mix greed in love not to make it changed.

> ⑵ However, there is no positive advantage in showing inferiority and envy to others.

> ⑶ The combination of desire and philosophy is really powerful.

> ⑷ Desire for knowledge is a healthier desire than other desires.

> ⑸ The ultimate desire is to have no desire.

<br>

**14.** People who are thirsty for growth should never stop growing. Because the exploding energy will be directed at themselves.

> ⑴ When a politician stops growing, his political life is over.

<br>

**15.** If a special person doesn't want to be lonely, he or she has to make the world a better place and find someone who can admit the value you follow.

> ⑴ Eventually, only the unfortunate genius who knows the secrets of the world changes the world.

> ⑵ Few people can confidently describe themselves as great people. But wouldn't you be able to confidently say you're a special person?

> ⑶ An altruist is at a disadvantage over an egoist, but in the end, he is empowered by people around him believing in his true feelings.

> ⑷ People empower those who believe they can.

<br>

**16.** If you look forward to tomorrow when you close your eyes, isn't that happiness?

<br>

**17.** One should have a philosophy to build huge wealth. The reasons are as follows.

> ⑴ Because a greater value is needed, as it is not beneficial to society that social resources are concentrated on certain individuals.

> ⑵ Because justification is needed for those who may feel deprived and jealous when social resources are concentrated on specific individuals.

> ⑶ Because it needs a value that surpasses the violation of the anti-trust regulation act. 

<br>

**18.** A life with news is proof that you are well off.

<br>

**19.** Trust is a priceless resource. Once lost, you can never get it back.

<br>

**20.** I'm not superior to others. I'm just more angry than others. 

<br>

**21.** If you are in Korea, you are evaluated as a job, and if you go abroad, you are evaluated as an achievement.

<br>

**22.** Without pain, humans cannot grow.

> ⑴ A man becomes the strongest when he or she is alone. 

> ⑵ Because they get bored easily.

> ⑵ The glass ceiling is not meant to lock yourself up. It's meant to be broken.

> ⑶ The world has never felt easy. The experiences strengthened me.

> ⑷ Conceit stops growth.

> ⑸ There are not many opportunities for growth. Thus, one needs to find his or her opportunity.

<br>

**23.** A diversified society does not line people up, so people are happier.

> ⑴ Society can be happier if it can present appearances with various charms instead of lookism.

<br>

**24.** The most obvious strategy for success is: the more, the better.

> ⑴ Because the utility by work is exponential. For example, it is possible to work three times more and earn ten times more.

> ⑵ Because, if we grow quantitatively, we grow qualitatively as well.

> ⑶ However, when speed and direction are matched, the probability of success increases.

<br>

**25.** Life is the art of possibility.

> ⑴ Life is sometimes impulsive rather than strategic.

<br>

**26.** The ant's law that 70% of the population don't work does not apply to humans. Because humans are special.

<br>

**27.** Irrational judgments made in an excited state often lead to wrong results. However, irrational judgments are sometimes right.

> ⑴ Brave choice is the most representative example.

<br>

**28.** It's a waste of time even to blame someone.

<br>

**29.** Fake envies the real.

<br>

**30.** I don't need others to agree with who I am. - Itaewon Class

<br>

**31.** It's better to be a bad person than a weak one.

<br>

**32.** Respect to all who challenge, and blessings to those who overcome.

<br>

**33.** You don't know the depth of the sea until you dive in.

<br>

**34.** Curiosity is the ability to define problems, something AI cannot do.

<br>

**35.** When you want to do something, you find a way. When you don't, you find an excuse. 

<br>

<br>

## **Relationship**

**36.** Love must be eternal and superior.

> ⑴ Just as electromagnetic wave becomes complete as electric and magnetic fields complement each other, love will be such.

<br>

**37.** If you really like someone, you should also have the courage to let go.

<br>

**38.** Marriage is a process of combining properties in many ways, and therefore there are many similarities with M&A.

<br>

**39.** It is a virtue to do a lot in the Science of Nature, and it is a virtue to take a balance in the Science of Human.

> ⑴ It is related to Nash Equilibrium in social science.

> ⑵ Human relationships may not be give and take. However, the work is clearly give and take.

<br>

**40.** Anger is nothing more than a hazard signal in a body. So there's no reason to be angry anymore if you've got everything you can get.

> ⑴ The mechanism of anger due to inferiority complex seems similar.

<br>

**41.** When you go out into society, it is meaningless whether a particular person is good or bad. It only matters whether the person is profitable or not.

<br>

**42.** No matter how good I am, there is 30% anti-fans. Also, no matter how wrong I am, there are 30% fans.

<br>

**43.** Like the wings of Icarus, relationships between people are not good if they are too close.

<br>

**44.** There is only contradiction in humans anyway. The important thing is when you notice the other person's contradiction.

> ⑴ The reason why contradictions occur in people is that they take two or more values as a premise.

> ⑵ As the distance between people gets closer, people's contradictions begin to appear.
 
> ⑶ Everyone has their own faults.

<br>

**45.** Fateful relationship is ...

> ⑴ Only when you are alone, you can see a fateful relationship.

> ⑵ The person next to you is the fateful relationship, not the person whom you find as the fateful relationship separately.

<br>

**46.** Man is not a suitable animal to live alone.

> ⑴ Being born as an animal and becoming a higher intellectual being also mean that people are unstable.

<br>

**47.** A dream dreamt alone is just a dream, but a dream dreamt together is reality.

<br>

**48.** Human nature tends to neglect its own possessions and covet those of others.

⑴ Therefore, someone who loves no one can potentially be loved by everyone.

<br>

**49.** When one turned 60, he or she realized that no one cared about him or her.

<br>

**50.** The relationship between a startup and its early employees is similar to a long-term relationship, both in the reasons for breaking up and in the difficulty of doing so.

<br>

**51**. Betrayal offers only short-term gains, whereas building trust is advantageous in the long term.

<br>

**52.** The clown sheds tears behind the mask.

<br>

<br>

## **Theory of Monarchs**

**53.** Kings still exist. This is advice for those who walk the path of a king.

<br>

**54.** The paradox of a dictator

> ⑴ Since the benefits of political power are concentrated only on a few, the dictator basically causes the majority's discontent.

> ⑵ The reason why a dictator takes the path of a war monarch is to resolve people's dissatisfaction through economic growth.

> ⑶ However, there is a way to become a technological powerhouse in addition to becoming a war monarch.

<br>

**55.** There are royal roads and apostles on the way to success.

> ⑴ An example of apostles is that they have secured many minor but loyal customers.

> ⑵ But how did Elon Musk become king by walking the apostle?

<br>

**56.** The king must be lonely.

> ⑴ First, it is because it is always lonely to pioneer a new paradigm and a new market.

> ⑵ Second, it is because only those who walk lonely paths can win public support.

> ⑶ Third, the king is not a job, but a sudden fate.

> ⑷ So if you're lonely, you're also walking the path of a king.

<br>

**57.** The king is special.

> ⑴ The king is neither a lawyer nor a doctor. The king is a king.

> ⑵ The king must meet the queen.

> ⑶ There are not many kings. Perhaps there cannot be more than one king in a kingdom as there cannot be two suns in a sky.

> ⑷ And kings are those who walk on paths that no one has ever walked on and go on paths that no one has ever reached.

<br>

**58.** There are three kinds of kings in the world.

> ⑴ A king who rules the people with authority and power.

> ⑵ A king with a free soul.

> ⑶ A king supported by all people.

<br>

<br>

**59.** Change always comes from the outside.

<br>

**60.** It's not a here if one didn't have a crisis.

> ⑴ Life is dramatic after all. The person who dramatically overcame the crisis wins in the end rather than the person whose everything is perfect.

> ⑵ Crisis always comes with opportunity.

<br>

**61.** Hero never die. If he or she was dead, it's not a hero already.

<br>

**62.** Leaders with poor background build leadership based on strong will. And it's superior.

<br>

**63.** The world is well-made. In the end, those who walk on an unnamed path dominate the world.

> ⑴ One Piece Animation: The world is well-made. Like Roger wasn't a man of ability.

<br>

<br>

**64.** A lot starts to be seen when authority is laid down.

<br>

**65.** Rather than forcing beliefs, it is desirable to spread them according to market principles.

<br>

**66.** In this world, there are some people who live a life as a public good, not a life of a private person.

> ⑴ Those who choose to believe in their philosophys should be rewarded.

<br>

**67.** God is one, and there are only several representatives of God.

<br>

**68.** Those who have gained tremendous wealth from self-made work have succeeded with two partial successes.

> ⑴ This was especially the case with Softbank Chairman Masayoshi Son, Kakao Chairman Kim Bum-soo, Elon Musk, and Steve Jobs.

> ⑵ In terms of time, they achieved success in their 20s and 30s and success in their 40s and 50s.

> ⑶ In particular, Chairman Masayoshi Son set a very specific goal when he was young, and he realized it all.

<br>

**69.** The king must speak the king's language.

<br>

**70.** The truth of this world conveyed by those who have reached the peak of the world can serve as an opportunity to resolve conflicts between classes.

<br>

**71.** There are many obstacles in the way of the king.

<br>

**72.** Fish in an aquarium are happy when they do not know the vastness of the ocean.

<br>

<br>

## **Social science**

**73.** A rapidly changing society implies a society with fluid social statuses.

<br>

**74.** There are three reasons why people need society.

> ⑴ First, a newborn child cannot live without parents.

> ⑵ Second, people have instincts like social animals.

> ⑶ Third, people belonging to a group are stronger than people who do not belong to a group.

<br>

**75.** Identifying wrongdoing reduces contradictions within a group, but we should be cautious as it can undermine the stability of the group.

> ⑴ It is wrong to be absolutely zero tolerance for wrongdoing because people can make mistakes.

> ⑵ There are more adults who make wrongdoings than you think. Because adults no longer believe in the values they believed in when they were young.

> ⑶ However, it is unjust to make contradictions to reduce contradictions. Therefore, excessive reform is also wrong.

> ⑷ The more principled a manager is, the healthier the organization is. This is because contradictions of the group are reduced and there is no harm to the stability of the group.

<br>

**76.** Learning is divided into science and art. A study of humanities is involved in art. 

<br>

**77.** Social science is the science of responsibility because it is related to consensus and policy, and natural science is the science of humility because it is related to objectivity.

<br>

**78.** I am politically neutral. However, voting is mandatory for me.

> ⑴ **Reason 1.** It is inefficient if the scientific and industrial sectors that require large investments are unnecessarily dominated by political pressure.

>> ① However, this reason does not seem to apply much to Elon Musk. Earlier this year, he saw President Biden intentionally passing Tesla Motors in the electric vehicle market and tweeted in anger to drive out Joe Biden, which does not seem to shake Elon Musk's position.

>> ② The reason why the U.S. raised Elon Musk and still does not restrict him is that Elon Musk can realize the infinite glory of the U.S. What you learn from history is that there is always a phase of decline when you have your heyday. However, if the U.S. monopolizes several planets alone, the U.S. potential will exceed that of all other countries. The reason why it is expressed as 'potential' here is that the United States will not unnecessarily stimulate competitors. 

> ⑵ **Reason 2.** Real politics, after all, is self-contradictory.

> ⑶ **Reason 3.** Only those who form a new force can eventually pioneer a new paradigm and a new market.

> ⑷ **Reason 4.** Because it is not desirable for the fruits of science and technology or new paradigms to pass on political beliefs to the same people.

> ⑸ For this, I should aim for the future rather than the present for political neutrality.

>> ① However, some dreamers and thinkers go to extremes because they are far from reality. 

> ⑹ For this, I should aim for integration rather than division.

<br>

**79.** The roles of politicians are largely classified in two ways.

> ⑴ Decrease of social conflict costs

> ⑵ Guarantee of one's right to life

> ⑶ In general, it is the domain of politicians to prevent short-term economic fluctuations. And it is the realm of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs that drive long-term economic growth.

<br>

**80.** I think politics and history are examples of punctuated equilibrium. Therefore, an attitude to explain history by dividing it into a specific period rather than a continuous flow is reasonable.

<br>

**81.** The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is that the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry.

> ⑴ Opportunity cost means the most valuable thing that you have given up for a choice. The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is that the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry. Obviously, all people's activities will have similar economic importance if they develop to a high level, but because of the logic of comparative advantage by opportunity cost, investment or development is focused on only areas that prosper at the moment.

<br>

**82.** The hierarchy of jobs causes social discontent. That is the driving force behind enterpreneurs with unnamed jobs.

<br>

**83.** A nation is a unit that maximizes economies of scale by sharing languages, history, culture, and industry. At the same time, it is a huge group that creates a sense of belonging, identity, and an evironment where people can live like humans.

<br>

**84.** There may be a moment when you have to seriously think about a company without employees, a school without students, and a country without population.

<br>

**85.** A healthy industry should be in a form where both skilled and unskilled workers can participate.

> ⑴ That is the case with the automobile industry.

> ⑵ The IT industry consists of 100% skilled workers, which is believed to have an inherent problem.

<br>

**86.** Computer engineering majors learn technology, while economics majors learn the world.

<br>

**87.** As society matures, professional occupations gain more power. South Korea has become quite a mature society. However, maturity is not necessarily a good thing.

<br>

**88.** Biology is closer to social science than to physics or chemistry. The reason for this is diversity, heterogeneity, and interaction.

<br>
<br>

## **Policy**

**89.** There are three major problems in Korea.

> ⑴ Low birth rate of 0.82 per couple

>> ① There are four main causes of low birth in Korea.

>>> ○ Population overcrowding due to the concentration of population in the capital area.

>>> ○ Increase of education cost.

>>> ○ A lack of impetus in economic growth.

>>> ○ A career break for women.

>> ② There are five main solutions of low birth in Korea.

>>> ○ Local investment.

>>> ○ Development the ultimate and best knowledge system. 

>>> ○ Promotion of new industries.

>>> ○ Transition of childcare teachers to public officials and national guarantee of infant education facilities attached to the workplace.

>>> ○ Active support for infertility policy and _in vitro_ fertilization

> ⑵ The fact of the only divided country in the world

> ⑶ The highest plastic usage

<br>

**90.** Innovation is a game making losers.

<br>

<br>

## **History science**

**91.** The Korean people are those who have never invaded. So it is a special and chosen people, especially in the globalized world.

<br>

**92.** History science has a different rule than game theory that explains social science.

<br>

**93.** To build a predictable history, leaders must be honest and sincere.

<br>
<br>

## **Futurology**

**94.** Science has constantly increased the quality of life.

> ⑴ It is hard to agree that science should be avoided just because it constantly create problems.

> ⑵ It's because bigger problems arise without science and technology than new problems arise with science and technology. For example, problems arise when society is stagnant, just as water rots when it is stagnant.

<br>

**95.** Humanity is progressing irreversibly.

> ⑴ Progress is good because it makes humanity worthwhile.

> ⑵ Water rots when it is stagnant. Therefore, human progress must last forever.

> ⑶ For example, space technology can develop as much as the size of the universe.

> ⑷ It is certainly advance of humanity that jobs are becoming diverse and complicated.

<br>

**96.** Science and technology transcend good and evil.

<br>

**97.** The difference between science and technology is that

> ⑴ Even if the material is the same,

> ⑵ Technology makes hiding a virtue and science makes disclosure a virtue.

> ⑶ Technology aims to foster new industries and complete existing industries (e.g. 99% → 99.9%),

> ⑷ Science aims to complete the Tower of Babel of Human Knowledge, answer countless questions, and think about what mankind should go on.

> ⑸ While technology aims to solve a given problem, science aims to define a new problem.

> ⑹ However, perhaps the distinction between science and technology is more of a social consensus than a strict one.

<br>

**98.** There are three reasons why K-content is currently popular in OTT (e.g., Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney Plus, Amazon Studios, etc.).

> ⑴ Because the Korean people have a 'good' image as non-invasion people.

> ⑵ Because Korea has freedom of thought; the impetus seems to come from the overwhelming distribution of IT devices.

> ⑶ Because Korea has experienced a rapid economic rise, giving a sense of homogeneity to developed countries and a sense of reverence to underdeveloped countries.

<br>

**99.** The next-generation innovative science field is diagnosed with five as follow. These fields share the commonality of being high-context disciplines with a significant amount of information.

> ⑴ Bio

> ⑵ Environment

> ⑶ Space

> ⑷ Quantum mechanics: quantum computers, fusion power, particle physics

> ⑸ IT: However, it's becoming difficult to view IT as an innovation industry because now there is no field that IT isn't involved in.

<br>

**100.** Giant industries are linked to human desires.

> ⑴ The field of IT is linked to entertainment.

> ⑵ The field of law is linked to frequent disputes between people.

> ⑶ The field of medicine is linked to the desire to live a healthy and long life.

> ⑷ The field of beauty is linked to the desire to be superior to others.

> ⑸ The field of space is linked to pure curiosity. So I think it's a special industry.

<br>

**101.** Industry is work places.

> ⑴ Can an IT industry that destroys other jobs and threatens the jobs of related workers be called an industry?

<br>

**102.** Biological trends are largely divided into two flows. That is the area of bioinformatics combine with data science and art such as chemical biology.

<br>

**103.** In the past, it is said that birds listen to day words and rats listen to night words. But the strange thing is, these days there are no birds or mice.

<br>

**104.** The more mechanized and automated civilization is, the more important the realm of art becomes.

<br>

**105.** Artificial intelligence does not have the innocence of a child.

<br>

**106.** There are four reasons why eco-friendly energy is important.

> ⑴ Now, the Russian-Ukraine war has threatened that Russia will not supply the world with energy. In the end, it is necessary to realize energy independence from the standpoint of energy security.

> ⑵ There has been some consensus that the global environment is destroyed by people. Eco-friendly marketing certainly works, and no one can easily refute it even if they set up trade barriers with emphasis on the environment.

> ⑶ The unit price of eco-friendly energy production continues to fall. In 100 years, all energy will be used as eco-friendly energy, so shouldn't we consider switching to eco-friendly energy from now on?

> ⑷ Green energy emphasizes scientific capabilities compared to other types of energy. Therefore, there is a high possibility that new industries will grow or start-ups and star entrepreneurs will emerge. There's already Solar City, as well, and it shows us that the focus on private enterprises rather than governments promotes job creation and huge economic growth. It also means that there are many things to study scientifically, so it can create other value-added industries.

<br>

**107.** Environmental problems should be solved by economic logic, not ethics.

<br>

**108.** Ten years from now, SpaceX's Starship reaches Mars. ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fxaAENrZYw)) What do we have to prepare for that?

> ⑴ **Topic 1.** Microbiome

>> ① There's no better way to make Mars a viable planet than microbes.

>> ② In fact, it was a microbe called cyanobacteria that generated oxygen on Earth when there was no oxygen in the air.

> ⑵ **Topic 2.** Agriculture 

>> ① It is important to exploit resources on Mars, and it seems more realistic to transport organic materials than heavy metals by spaceships.

>> ② Organic materials can be used as food, but it can also be used as an energy source.

>> ③ Energy source is important because they can be sold on Earth or used for spaceships.

>> ④ To realize such agriculture, completely unmanned agriculture and plants growing on Mars will become a hot topic.

> ⑶ **Topic 3.** Wouldn't a city on Mars declare an independent state?

> ⑷ **Topic 4.** Why the U.S. raised Elon Musk and he is still not constrained

>> ① Elon Musk can make America's infinite glory come true.

>> ② What you learn from history is that there are always stages of decline when there is a golden age.

>> ③ But Mars exploration is a game changer that can change the corollary of history.

>> ④ However, space industry competition will be triggered due to China and Russia, and the risk of war may increase.

>> ⑤ In the meantime, space scientists may be making a lot of money.
