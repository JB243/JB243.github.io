## **3. Galilean Relativity**

⑴ Characteristics

> ① Very familiar concepts to us.

> ② The law of addition of velocities holds.

> ③ Inertial frame: A frame with zero acceleration.

⑵ Coordinate Transformations

> ① Let observer X start from (0, 0, 0) and move with a velocity of (u, 0, 0).

> ② Let there be a point P(x, 0, 0).

> ③ According to a stationary observer Y, P is still at (x, 0, 0).

> ④ Observer X initially perceived P at coordinates (x, 0, 0).

> ⑤ After moving a time t, observer X perceives P at coordinates (x - ut, 0, 0).

⑶ Newtonian mechanics satisfies the principle of relativity.

⑷ Inertial and Accelerated Frames

> ① Inertial frame: A coordinate system defined relative to an observer at rest or moving with constant velocity.

> ② Accelerated frame: A coordinate system defined relative to an observer undergoing accelerated motion.

> ③ Practical distinction: Inertial frames have no inertial forces. Accelerated frames experience inertial forces.

>> ○ Observer in an elevator accelerating upward by a: The observer perceives an additional inertial force downward of ma.

>> ○ Observer in an elevator accelerating downward by a: The observer perceives an additional inertial force upward of ma.

>> ○ Observer moving in uniform circular motion: The observer perceives a centrifugal force equal to ma.

> ④ The acceleration experienced by an observer is not relative, as it implies the presence of inertial forces.

⑸ Finite Speed of Light

> ① **Evidence 1:** Jupiter's Moon (eclipse)

>> ○ Giovanni Cassini (1625-1712)

>>> ○ Shorter eclipse time when Earth is closer to Jupiter.

>>> ○ Longer eclipse time when Earth is farther from Jupiter.

>> ○ Rømer's argument

>>> ○ Difference in eclipse time attributed to difference in light travel time.

>>> ○ Conclusion: Light speed is finite.

> ② **Evidence 2:** Toothed-wheel experiment

>> ○ In reality, the wheel must rotate very fast to not obstruct the reflected light.

## **4. Special Theory of Relativity** 

⑴ Einstein's Idea

> ① 1st: Around 1870, the concept began to be used.

> ② 2nd: For trains, a method of synchronizing clocks is needed to know departure and arrival times.

> ③ 3rd: No method existed at the time to synchronize clocks in different regions.

> ④ 4th: Many patents for clock synchronization were filed with the Swiss Patent Office.

> ⑤ 5th: Einstein was working at the Swiss Patent Office at the time.

> ⑥ 6th: Einstein realized that the signal takes more time to reach him when he looks at a clock to know the current time.

> ⑦ 7th: In other words, Einstein understood that wristwatches and biological clocks cannot show the same time.

> ⑧ 8th: Furthermore, Einstein believed that time is not absolute.

⑵ Law of the Invariance of the Speed of Light

> ① Maxwell's equations

>> ○ Maxwell discovered that electrical phenomena are described by the wave equation of electromagnetic waves.

>> ○ Discovered that the speed of electromagnetic waves is similar to the known speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s).

>> ○ Concluded that light is an electromagnetic wave.

> ② Ether theory

>> ○ All waves require a medium to propagate.

>> ○ Light is an electromagnetic wave, thus it must have a medium called ether.

>> ○ When light moves through ether, its speed varies according to the speed of ether.

**Figure. 1.** Example of Ether Flow 

> ③ Einstein's Idea

>> ○ Electrical phenomena occur whether an object is moving or stationary.

>> ○ Precisely 3 × 10^8 m/s velocity of electromagnetic waves is required for electrical phenomena to occur ( **∵** Maxwell's equations).

>> ○ Electrical phenomena occur even in a moving frame.

>> ○ Therefore, the speed of light is constant.

> ④ Evidence: Michelson-Morley Interference Experiment

**Figure. 2.** Michelson-Morley Interference Experiment 

>> ○ Michelson interferometer is a precise instrument to observe interference patterns.

>> ○ Improved the precision of the Michelson-Morley experiment over 50 years.

>>> ○ Michelson, _Studies in Optics_ (1881)

>>> ○ Shankland, et al., Rev. Mod. Phys. 27, 167 (1955)

>> ○ Even though the same light starts, there is a time difference when it arrives after reflection in the mirror.

>>> ○ Assume the speed of ether is **v** = (vx, vy).

>>> ○ Calculating the time difference.

>> ○ **Result 1:** The interference pattern does not shift when the Michelson-Morley interferometer is rotated, refuting the ether theory.

>>> ○ For a time difference equivalent to one more wavelength, constructive interference should occur.

>> ○ **Result 2:** Since the ether theory is refuted, the speed of light is constant.

>> ○ Michelson and Morley concluded that they couldn't measure the speed of ether due to the experiment's low precision.

>> ○ One of the few cases where a Nobel Prize was awarded for the absence of results.

⑶ Special Theory of Relativity

> ① Einstein published his first paper at the age of 26 in 1905.

>> ○ First paper: "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies."

> ② Assumptions

>> ○ **Assumption 1:** Physical laws are the same in any inertial frame (including Maxwell's equations).

>> ○ **Assumption 2:** The speed of light in a vacuum is the same in any inertial frame.

>> ○ **Assumption 3:** The observer's coordinate system must be inertial with respect to the observed object.

> ③ **Application 1:** Simultaneity and Heterochrony of Events

>> ○ Even if events happen simultaneously, they appear differently depending on the observer's motion state.

**Figure. 3.** Simultaneity and Heterochrony of Events 

>> ○ While A sees light emitted from P and R reaching Q simultaneously, the same occurs when seen by B.

>>> ○ The relativity of simultaneity means different observers can see the sequence of different events differently.

>>> ○ However, this doesn't mean facts about a single event are viewed differently.

**Figure. 4.** Caution Regarding Simultaneity of Events 

> ④ **Application 2:** Relative Velocity

>> ○ Situation: A and B moving at constant velocities.

>> ○ Conclusion: The magnitude of the relative velocity seen by A looking at B and by B looking at A is the same.

>> ○ Very important concept.

> ⑤ **Application 3:** Time Dilation

**Figure. 5.** Time Dilation Modeling 

>> ○ Event: Light starts at the initial point, reflects at the mirror, and returns to the initial point.

>> ○ Time Δt0 measured by the observer in the spaceship.

>> ○ Time Δt measured by the observer on the ground.

>> ○ Summary: An observer sees a moving object as if it is moving slowly.

>> ○ **Example 1:** Muons generated in the stratosphere have a half-life of 2.2 × 10^-6 seconds at rest.

>> ○ **Example 2:** Inside the stratosphere with v = 0.999c, its half-life is 1.1 × 10^-3 seconds.

> ⑥ **Application 4:** Length Contraction

**Figure. 6.** Length Contraction Modeling 

>> ○ Thought experiment: Relative velocity v is the same for the observer in the spaceship and the observer on the ground.

>> ○ Derived length contraction: Using the constant relative velocity.

>>> ○ Δt **:** Time taken by the moving object in the observer's frame of reference. Measured as a delayed time.

>>> ○ L0 **:** Distance between two points P and Q measured in the observer's frame of reference.

>>> ○ Δt<sub>0</sub> **:** Time taken by the observer at rest to measure the moving observer's time.

>>> ○ L **:** Distance between two points P and Q measured in the moving observer's frame of reference.

>>> ○ Time is important from the moving observer's viewpoint, so the time measured by the moving observer becomes the "proper time."

>>> ○ Distance between P and Q is important from the moving observer's viewpoint, so the distance measured by the moving observer becomes the "proper distance."

>>> ○ Events at P or Q for the moving observer do not have simultaneity from the observer's perspective.

>>> ○ Thus, even if the moving observer reaches Q, the observer appears not to have reached Q.

<center>Δt > Δt<sub>0</sub></center>

>>> ○ (Comment) It's important to properly understand the meanings of each symbol.

>>> ○ (Comment) Personally, considering the essence of the theory of relativity, it's inappropriate to label a certain measured quantity by an intrinsic physical quantity.

>> ○ Summary **:** When observing a moving object, the object appears shortened.

>> ○ **Example 1:** From the perspective of a muon, to travel from the stratosphere to the Earth's surface within 2.2 × 10^-6 seconds, the distance must be shortened.

>> ○ Light moving at v = -c can be represented by blue color.

>> ○ In this case, angle θ between ct' axis and ct axis is 45°.

> ③ Creating the Spacetime Axis

**Figure. 12.** Definition of Spacetime Axis for World Line Diagram of Moving Object

>> ○ Coordinates on the x-axis are all at t = 0.

>> ○ Therefore, coordinates on the x' axis are all at t' = 0.

>> ○ For ct' to be 0, ct - βx = 0, which means ct = βx.
