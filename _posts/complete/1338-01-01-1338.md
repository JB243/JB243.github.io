## **1\. Overview**

 ⑴ Types **:** Elements that exist as gases at standard conditions (25 ℃, 1 atm)

> ① Monoatomic Gases **:** He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn (Noble gases, Group 8A elements)

> ② Diatomic Gases **:** H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, etc.

 ⑵ Physical Characteristics **:** Most gases have similar physical properties

> ① Represented by volume and shape of the container

> ② State of matter with the highest compressibility

## **2\. History of Gas Studies**

 ⑴ Torricelli Experiment

> ① Experiment Process **:** The height of the mercury column in an inverted tube is always constant.

> ② Application **:** Experiment to measure atmospheric pressure

> ③ [Pressure](https://jb243.github.io/pages/933)[Law](https://jb243.github.io/pages/933)

 ⑵ Boyle's Law

> ① Introduced by R. Boyle in 1662

> ② At a constant temperature, the volume of a fixed amount of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure (P ≪ 1)

 ⑶ Charles's Law

> ① Introduced by J.A.C. Charles in 1787

> ② At a constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature

> ③ Introduction of Absolute Temperature (Kelvin temperature)

>> ○ Absolute zero is the point where the linear extension of the V - T curve intersects the x-axis.

>> ○ In reality, as temperature drops, gases liquefy or vaporize, making it impossible to determine the extrapolation point.

>> ○ However, since all gases have the same extrapolation point, this has special significance, leading to the introduction of absolute zero and absolute temperature concepts.

 ⑷ Avogadro's Law **:** At constant temperature and pressure + (P ≪ 1)

> ① Volume of 1 mole of gas at standard pressure (1 bar) and standard temperature (0 ℃) is 22.4 L

 ⑸ Ideal Gas Equation **:** Applicable to all types of gases

> ① Gas constant **:** Represented as R

>> ○ 8.31446 J / mol·K

>> ○ 8.20574 × 10-2 L·atm / K·mol

>> ○ 287 J / kg·K **:** **Tip:** Commonly used in industrial thermodynamics

> ② Limiting laws that apply only under certain conditions (pressure ≪ 1)

 ⑹ Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures **:** The ratio of partial pressures is equal to the ratio of the number of gas molecules

## **3\. Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases:** Describes the model for ideal gases

 ⑴ Rules of Kinetic Molecular Theory

> ① **Rule 1:** Gases undergo continuous random walk motion.

> ② **Rule 2:** Point mass **:** Gas molecules have infinitesimally small volume.

> ③ **Rule 3:** Gas particles undergo straight-line motion.

> ④ **Rule 4:** No interaction **:** Gases do not interact except during collisions.

> ⑤ **Rule 5:** Elastic collision **:** Collisions between gas molecules are perfectly elastic.

> ⑥ **Rule 6:** Energy Equipartition Law **:** Average kinetic energy of gas molecules is proportional to temperature.

>> ○ Formulation

>> ○ **Note:** Zeroth law of thermodynamics **:** Defines the equality of temperatures through thermal equilibrium.

>> ○ **Note:** Experimental definition of temperature scale **:** Expansion of a thermometer due to heat

>>> ○ Mercury thermometer **:** Silver thermometer

>>> ○ Alcohol thermometer **:** Red thermometer. Appears red due to dye.

>> ○ Physical significance **:** Defines the temperature scale such that the kinetic energy of gas molecules is linearly proportional to temperature.

>> ○ Directly deduced in [thermodynamics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1579) that internal energy is a function of temperature.

 ⑵ Physical Derivation of the Ideal Gas Equation

> ① Let's consider calculating the pressure on the right side perpendicular to the x-axis.

> ② Keep in mind that gas molecules continuously undergo elastic collisions with walls like billiard balls.

> ③ **Period** **:** The time it takes for a gas molecule to collide with the right side.

> ④ **Step 4** **:** Remember that a gas molecule moving towards the right side will collide, move away from the right side after the collision, and continue moving.

> ⑤ **Force** **:** The average force exerted by a gas molecule on the right side **:** Force = Fa = Rate of change of momentum = dp / dt

> ⑥ **Leap of faith** **:** Science sometimes makes risky assumptions, but if the results are beautiful, they are forgiven.

> ⑦ **Pressure derivation** **:** Using the definition of pressure P = F / A

> ⑧ **Average number of colliding molecules per unit time on the wall**

>> ○ Average number of colliding molecules on one side per unit time

>> ○ Average number of colliding molecules on the entire wall per unit time

## **4\. Physicochemical Analysis of Gases**

 ⑴ Graham's Law

> ① **Diffusion** **:** Process where a substance mixes into another due to molecular collisions

> ② **Effusion** **:** Movement of particles from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area (e.g., movement of particles in a vacuum)

> ③ Graham's Law

>> ○ Content **:** Effusion rate ∝ 1 / √M

>> ○ Inference **:** Since they are at the same temperature, their kinetic energies are the same.

>> ○ Graham's law can also be applied to diffusion rates.

>> ○ Applied in the Manhattan Project for uranium enrichment

> ④ Frequency of gas molecules colliding with the wall

>> ○ Proportional to the effusion rate

>> ○ Frequency of gas molecules colliding with the wall ∝ Moles / Volume × Average Velocity

> ② **Meaning 1:** Set to make the sum of all values equal to 1

> ③ **Meaning 2:** Form of the normal distribution function

> ④ **Meaning 3:** Setting to match the formula of root mean square velocity

> ⑤ **Result 1:** Root Mean Square Velocity (vrms)

> ⑥ **Result 2:** Average Velocity (vavg) **:** Can be calculated through integration

> ⑦ **Result 3:** Most Probable Velocity (vmp) **:** Can be found by differentiating to locate the maximum

> ⑧ **Result 4:** Relative Velocity (vrel)

> ⑨ As the molecular weight increases and the temperature decreases, the speed distribution fits well **:** (Note) Light molecules bounce quickly at high speeds.
