## **1. Darwinian Biology**

⑴ Before Darwin

> ① Linnaeus: Thought that diversity of species is the created form of species

> ② Cuvier

> ③ James Hutton (1726-1797): Gradualism

>> ○ It took much more than 6,000 years for the current landscape to form

>> ○ Natural changes are gradual, not abrupt

> ④ Charles Lyell (1797-1875): Uniformitarianism

>> ○ The speed of past changes is the same as the speed of current changes

> ⑤ Jean Babtiste de Lamarck (1744-1829): Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics

>> ○ Hypothesized that organs used frequently develop while unused organs degenerate

>> ○ In 1809, in "Philosophie Zoologique," he claimed that organisms on Earth can change over time

>> ○ Recent emphasis on the heredity of acquired traits

> ⑥ Thomas Malthus (1766-1834): "An Essay on the Principle of Population"

>> ○ Population growth is geometric, food production is arithmetic

>> ○ Darwin connected Malthus's ideas to the survival of the fittest in natural selection

⑵ Darwin

> ① Natural Selection: Traits that enable survival thrive in populations and change over time.

> ② Mayer's Logical Inference

>> ○ **Observation 1:** If all individuals reproduce successfully, the population size grows exponentially

>> ○ **Observation 2:** Most populations remain stable in size

>> ○ **Observation 3:** Resources are limited

>> ○ **Inference 1:** Only some survive, leading to competition for resources

>> ○ **Observation 4:** Population members have diverse traits

>> ○ **Observation 5:** A significant portion of variations within a population are hereditary

>> ○ **Inference 2:** Traits with higher survival and reproductive probabilities exist

>> ○ **Inference 3:** Differential survival and reproduction lead to gradual changes in populations over generations

⑶ Evidence for Evolution

> ① Ongoing Natural Selection (Microevolution)

>> ○ Example: Finch populations

>> ○ Example: Evolution of drug resistance in HIV

> ② Homology

>> ○ Anatomical Homology

>>> ○ **Example 1:** Mammalian forelimbs: Different functions but shared origin (homologous structures)

>>> ○ **Example 2:** Tail: Humans have vestigial coccyx like primates, but no tail

>>> ○ **Example 3:** Piloerector muscles (arrector pili): Tiny muscles at the base of hair, contract to make hair stand on end

>>> ○ **Example 4:** Thorns of roses and tendrils of grapes

>> ○ Ontogenetic Homology (Haeckel's Recapitulation Theory): Individual development recapitulates ancestral development.

>>> ○ Example: All chordates develop pharyngeal pouches like in a single common ancestor, shared developmental path with tails

>> ○ Vestigial Organs: Present in modern plants but no longer serve a function

>>> ○ Examples: Human appendix, human tailbone

> ③ Analogous Organs: Not evidence of evolution, refers to convergent evolution

>> ○ Example: Vines of ivy and vines of grapes

> ④ Molecular Biology Evidence (Similarity of DNA)

>> ○ Example: Birds of the same genus have more similar DNA sequences

>> ○ Example: Human (100%) - Chimpanzee (99.01%) - Gorilla (98.90%) - African Monkey (96.66%)

> ⑤ Biogeographical Evidence

>> ○ Examples: Related species found in close geographical proximity (Galápagos and Ecuador finches)

>> ○ Example: Ancestral human fossils found in Africa, where hominids resided

>> ○ Example: Pacific snapping shrimp and Atlantic snapping shrimp were the same species before the formation of the Isthmus of Panama 3 million years ago

> ⑥ Fossil Record

>> ○ Example: Sequence of evolutionary changes in the horse lineage

⑷ Validity of Alternative Evolutionary Hypotheses

> ① Static Model: Earth is much older than 6,000 years, and species clearly change over time (rejected)

> ② Transformism: Evidence of flexible relationships between organisms is abundant (rejected)

> ③ Individual Type Theory: Universality of DNA, genetic code, and cellular composition provide evidence for a single origin of life (rejected)

> ④ Without Evolution, it's difficult to explain the universality of DNA and protein mechanisms

## **2. Microevolution**

⑴ Definition: Change in gene pool (less controversial)

> ① Natural selection manifests as phenotypic changes, while microevolution manifests as changes in allele frequencies within a population.

⑵ Gene Pool and Allele Frequency

> ① Population: A group of individuals (same species) capable of producing offspring

> ② Population Genetics

> ③ Gene Pool

> ④ Allele Frequency

>> ○ The sum of frequencies of all alleles is 1

>> ○ For 2 alleles, in Mendelian genetics, with dominant allele frequency A and recessive allele frequency a:

>> ○ Dominant genotype ratio: A2 + 2Aa

>> ○ Recessive genotype ratio: a2

⑶ Hardy-Weinberg Law

> ① Conservation of Allele Frequencies: Mendelian genetic processes alone cannot alter allele frequencies (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium)

> ② (p + q)2 = p2 + 2 · p · q + q2 = 1 (where p and q are frequencies of 2 alleles)

> ③ Conditions for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

>> ○ Large population size where probability can work

>> ○ Random mating

>> ○ Absence of migration and gene flow

>> ○ No mutations

>> ○ No natural selection

>> ○ If any of these conditions is violated, evolution occurs

⑷ Microevolution: When Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium is Broken

> ① Genetic Drift: Phenomenon where allele frequency changes in a small population

>> ○ In small populations, alleles can be lost or fixed due to the finite number of mates each generation

>> ○ Types: Bottleneck effect (dramatic and temporary decrease in population size, leading to changes in allele frequency) and founder effect (small group isolates from a larger population, forming a new gene pool)

>> ○ Random events: A carrier of a rare allele might not reproduce

> ② Non-random Mating: Mating that is not random

>> ○ Homogamy (non-homosexuality)

>> ○ Sexual Selection (intersexual selection): Selection of mates to maximize reproductive ability; e.g., sexual dimorphism

>> ○ Heterogamy (intersexual selection): Tendency for organisms to mate with individuals resembling themselves

>> ○ Artificial selection for quality improvement

> ③ Mutation

>> ○ Substitution rate in mammalian DNA sequences: 3 ~ 5 × 10-9 substitutions/nucleotide/year

>> ○ Substitution rate in human influenza virus DNA sequences: 2 × 10-3 substitutions/nucleotide/year

> ④ Gene Flow (Migration)

> ⑤ Natural Selection: Favorable mutations increase in frequency, unfavorable mutations decrease; no new traits are created

>> ○ Stabilizing Selection: Selects intermediate phenotypes, stabilizes gene pool

>> ○ Directional Selection: Selects one extreme phenotype, gene pool shifts in a specific direction

>> ○ Disruptive Selection: Selects both extreme phenotypes, gene pool splits into two distinct groups

>> ○ Increased effects of natural selection

>>> ○ When dominant phenotype is detrimental: Heterozygotes also suffer elimination

>>> ○ When environment changes rapidly

>> ○ Examples: Increased UV radiation ⇒ increased vitamin D, decreased folic acid

>>> ○ Low UV ⇒ Light skin (optimal vitamin D)

>>> ○ High UV ⇒ Dark skin (optimal folic acid)

> ⑥ Hybridization: Reproduction between different species

 ⑸ Conservation of Genetic Variation

> ① Diploidy

> ② Sexual Recombination

> ③ Balancing Selection

>> ○ Heterozygote Advantage: When heterozygotes are more fit than homozygotes

>>> ○ HbA: Adult hemoglobin, HbS: Sickle cell hemoglobin

>>> ○ HbA/HbA: Malaria sensitivity

>>> ○ HbA/HbS: Malaria resistance

>>> ○ HbS/HbS: Anemia

>> ○ Frequency-Dependent Selection

> ④ Neutral Mutation

⑹ Consequences of Genetic Variation

> ① Homologous Genes

> ② Orthologous Genes (Parallel Homologs): Genes that originated from a common ancestral gene but diverged during speciation

> ③ Paralogous Genes (Serial Homologs): Genes within a single species that are duplicated, creating 2 alleles

⑺ Evolutionary Fitness

> ① Fitness: Normalized value between 0 and 1 that represents the ratio of the number of offspring with a specific genotype to the number of parents with that genotype

>> ○ Biological meaning: Relative survival and reproduction ÷ reproductive capability

>> ○ Meaning of normalization: Adjusts the factor to make the most common genotype's fitness 1

>> ○ Higher fitness means better survival and reproduction

> ② Adaptive Traits: Traits that enhance an organism's fitness in a given environment

> ③ Selection Coefficient: Difference in fitness between two organisms

>> ○ Ranges from 0 to 1

## **3. Evolutionary Development**

 ⑴ Evolutionary Process = Speciation **←** Subspeciation + … + Subspeciation **←** Common Ancestor (Common Ancestral Theory), (subject to controversy)

 ⑵ **Biological Species Concept** **:** Group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring in nature

> ① Prezygotic Barrier **:** Prevents mating from occurring

>> ○ Geographic Isolation **:** No contact between different species

>> ○ Temporal Isolation **:** Different species breed at different times

>> ○ Behavioral Isolation **:** Differences in mating behaviors

>> ○ Mechanical Isolation **:** Differences in reproductive structures

>>> Example **:** Reproductive structures of insects that fit together like locks and keys

>> ○ Gametic Isolation **:** Proteins on the surface of eggs do not allow sperm from different species to fertilize

>> ○ Reinforcement of Isolation **:** Prezygotic barriers are stronger in cases where genetically close species coexist in the same area

>>> ○ Due to strong selection pressure preventing hybridization among closely related species

> ② Postzygotic Barrier **:** Hybridization occurs but hybrids are sterile

>> ○ Hybrid Breakdown (hybrid vigor lost) **:** Developmental failure due to incomplete genetic information

>>> Example **:** Cross between goat and sheep produces offspring but they die at an early developmental stage

>> ○ Hybrid Sterility **:** Hybrids cannot undergo meiosis due to lack of homologous chromosomes

>> ○ Hybrid Disintegration **:** First-generation hybrids are healthy but subsequent generations experience reduced survival and reproduction

> ③ **Example 1:** Liger

>> ○ Offspring of a tiger and a lion

>> ○ Not a biological species due to lack of fertility

>> ○ Tigers and lions are not the same species

> ④ **Example 2:** Mule

>> ○ Offspring of a female horse and a male donkey

>> ○ Not a biological species due to lack of fertility

>> ○ Female horse and male donkey are not the same species

 ⑶ Limits of Biological Species Concept

> ① Cases where Biological Species Concept cannot be applied

>> ○ Asexual reproduction

>> ○ Difficulty in confirming reproductive compatibility between organisms

>> ○ Cases of fossil species

> ② Alternative species concepts

>> ○ **Morphological Species Concept**

>>> ○ Conventional species concept based on external characteristics

>>> ○ Most commonly used species concept in classification

>>> ○ Pros **:** Applicable to asexual organisms and fossil organisms where biological species cannot be verified

>>> ○ Cons **:** Does not always reflect evolutionary independence.

>>> ○ Example **:** Estimating relationships when reconstructing the emergence and migration of ancestral humans

>>> ○ Example **:** Wolves and dogs are not considered the same species despite being capable of interbreeding

>> ○ **Paleontological Species Concept**

>> ○ **Ecological Species Concept**

>>> ○ Based on ecological similarity

>>> ○ Classifies organisms with similar ecological niches as the same species

>> ○ **Phylogenetic and Ontogenetic Species Concept**

>>> ○ Groups organisms with the same evolutionary history using morphological and DNA sequence data

>>> ○ Species with the same genetic characteristics that diverged from a common ancestor

 ⑷ Mechanisms of Speciation

> ① Allopatric Speciation **:** Speciation due to geographical isolation within a single population

> ② Sympatric Speciation **:** Speciation occurring within the same geographical area

>> ○ Type 1: Sexual Selection **:** Occurs when individuals with specific genetic traits are more likely to mate

>> ○ Type 2: Habitat Differentiation **:** Subpopulations exploit different habitats or resources

>> ○ Type 3: Polyploidy **:** Occurs due to errors in chromosome addition during cell division

>> ○ Autopolyploidy

>> ○ Allopolyploidy **:** Forms from hybrids of different species and undergoes various processes to become a polyploid

>>> ○ Around 50% of flowering plants are derived from polyploidy

>>> ○ Example: Canola **:** A hybrid of kale and turnip, canola results from an error in chromosome segregation, resulting in a triploid with restored fertility

>> ○ Principle of Trait Substitution **:** Trait differentiation tends to be higher in sympatric populations than in allopatric ones

> ③ Adaptation Radiation **:** Process where life forms evolve into various directions to adapt to their environment

>> ○ Natural selection improves adaptation to current conditions rather than past improvement

>> ○ Natural selection does not drive progress towards a goal

> ④ **Theory 1:** Gradualism or Gradual Evolution Theory

>> ○ Proposed by Darwin

>> ○ Theory that small changes accumulate gradually over millions of years leading to speciation

> ⑤ **Theory 2:** [Punctuated Equilibrium Theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1146)

>> ○ Proposed by Stephen Jay Gould

>> ○ Suggests that after rapid changes in form, there is little change over time due to the absence of intermediate forms in the fossil record

>> ○ Currently combined with the Evo-devo theory, related to homeobox genes

> ⑥ Rebuttal of Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

>> ○ Genetic changes are fundamentally gradual and lack direction

>> ○ In stable environments, gradual genetic changes lead to minimal species change

>> ○ In changing environments, specific genetic changes in individuals lead to rapid species change

>> ○ Earth's history shows rapid environmental changes, leading to punctuated equilibrium

 ⑸ Factors Influencing Speciation Rate

> ① Species Richness **:** Higher speciation rate within a lineage with more species

> ② Range Size

> ③ Behavior

> ④ Environmental Change

> ⑤ Generation Time

<br>

## **4. Evo-devo Evolutionary Theory**

 ⑴ Evo-devo (Evolutionary Developmental Biology) Theory

 ⑵ HOX Genes and deep relationship

 ⑶ Supports the Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

<br>

<br>

## **5. Tree of Life and Evolutionary Theory**

 ⑴ Common Characteristics of Organisms **:** Because they originated from a common ancestor

> ① All organisms have the same basic biochemistry and share the same types of macromolecules

> ② All organisms are composed of cells and have a bilayer lipid membrane as their outer boundary

> ③ Eukaryotic cells share almost identical organelles

 ⑵ Phylogenetic Tree **:** Represents the path of evolution as a branching tree

 ⑶ Phylogenetic Methods **:** Molecular Clock

> ① Tracking using rRNA **:** rRNA has the slowest evolutionary rate

>> ○ Hemoglobin, cytochrome c, fibrinogen, histone proteins can also be used

>> ○ Mitochondrial DNA generally mutates about 10 times faster than nuclear DNA

> ② Principle of Parsimony (Minimum Evolution) **:** Choose the phylogenetic tree

 with the fewest trait changes

>> ○ DNA-DNA hybridization experiment **:** Closer relationships have higher DNA melting temperatures (Tm)

> ③ Characteristics

>> ○ Ancestral forms are positioned lower, closer relationships are placed closer

>> ○ Slowly evolving sequences allow tracking of distant evolutionary history

>> ○ Over long periods, substitution rates slow due to synonymous substitutions in nucleotide and amino acid sequences

>>> Note: The error rate of DNA polymerase is constant during replication of genes

> ④ Clades

>> ○ Monophyletic Clade **:** Common ancestor and all its descendants

>> ○ Paraphyletic Clade **:** Includes common ancestor and some of its descendants

>>> Example **:** Birds evolved from reptiles, but birds are excluded from the paraphyletic reptile group

>> ○ Polyphyletic Clade **:** Includes groups with different common ancestors

> ⑤ Derived Traits

>> ○ Primitive Character **:** Trait shared by all groups derived from a common ancestor

>> ○ Derived Character **:** Trait present in a group but absent in its ancestors

>> ○ Synapomorphy **:** Unique trait found only in a specific clade, used as evidence in building phylogenies

>> ○ Paraphyletic Clades

> ⑤ Traits Based on Clades
