## **1\. Overview**

 ⑴ Earth's field **:** Flow of Earth's forces

 ⑵ Fields are divided into gravitational and magnetic fields

<br>

## **2. Earth's Gravitational Field**

 ⑴ Gravity

> ① Definition of gravity **:** Sum of the universal force towards the center of the Earth and the centrifugal force due to Earth's rotation that objects on Earth receive

> ② Universal force F is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two objects and directly proportional to the product of their masses

>> ○ Gravity is maximum at the poles and minimum at the equator

> ③ Centrifugal force **:** f = mrω2 (r **:** distance from the axis of rotation, ω **:** angular velocity of Earth's rotation)

>> ○ Centrifugal force is zero at the poles and maximum at the equator

> ④ Direction of gravity **:** Toward the center of the Earth at the equator and poles, not toward the center at other places

 ⑵ Measurement of gravity

> ① Using gravimeter **:** Using a sensitive plumb line balance

> ② Use of pendulum method **:** The period of a pendulum with length ℓ is as follows

> ③ Measurement of universal gravitational constant **:** Measured for the first time by the Cavendish experiment

**Figure. 1.** Cavendish Experiment

 ⑶ Gravitational acceleration

> ① Surface gravitational acceleration

>> ○ Small-scale movements on the Earth's surface have constant gravity due to nearly constant distance between objects and the Earth

>> ○ Gravitational acceleration varies locally due to differences in underground density and equatorial centrifugal force

> ② Gravitational acceleration in the atmosphere

> ③ Gravitational acceleration within the Earth

>> ○ When calculating gravitational acceleration within the Earth, the outer shell beyond a specific point doesn't have an effect (**∵** principle of similarity)

**Figure. 2.** Gravitational Acceleration Inside Earth and Shell

>> ○ Assuming constant Earth density, gravitational acceleration is proportional to the distance from the Earth's center

> ④ Actual profile of Earth's gravitational acceleration

**Figure. 3.** Actual Profile of Earth's Gravitational Acceleration

> ⑤ Gravity on the Earth's surface is 6 times that on the Moon's surface

 ⑷ Anomalies in gravity

> ① Standard gravity **:** Theoretical value calculated for a uniform ellipsoid closest to the geoid with the same mass as the actual Earth, as a function of latitude (Φ)

> ② Gravity anomaly = Measured gravity - Standard gravity

>> ○ Positive gravity anomaly **:** Presence of high-density materials (e.g., iron ore, basalt)

>> ○ Negative gravity anomaly **:** Presence of low-density materials (e.g., petroleum, halite)

> ③ Correctional gravity **:** Gravity on a flat terrain on the geoid

> ④ Bouguer anomaly = Correctional gravity - Standard gravity

>> ○ Bouguer anomaly appears due to differences in underground material density

>> ○ (+) value in regions with high underground density (mainly ocean), (-) value in regions with low underground density (mainly land)

> ⑤ Distribution of gravity anomalies **:** Also called "Potato Model" of gravity anomalies

**Figure. 4.** Potato Model of Gravity Anomalies

 ⑸ Role of Gravity

> ① Forms in the contraction of cold interstellar material → Energy source in Earth's early formation

 ⑹ Isostasy

> ① Theory that low-density lithospheres float on high-density mantle while maintaining equilibrium

> ② In this equilibrium process, compensatory movement occurs

> ③ **Theory 1.** Pratt's hypothesis **:** Different lithospheric densities with the same Moho depth. (Note) Remember as "flat"

> ④ **Theory 2.** Airy's hypothesis **:** Same lithospheric density with different Moho depths

**Figure. 5.** Comparison of Pratt's and Airy's Hypotheses

> ⑤ Actual lithosphere fits with Airy's hypothesis since it's divided into continental and oceanic lithospheres, and Pratt's hypothesis applies to each lithosphere

**Figure. 6.** Isostasy in Actual Lithosphere

 ⑺ Motion of Artificial Satellites

> ① First cosmic velocity **:** Velocity required for circular motion just above Earth's surface. About 7.9 km/s

> ② Second cosmic velocity **:** Escape velocity required to leave Earth's gravitational field from its surface. About 11.2 km/s

> ③ Third cosmic velocity **:** Escape velocity required to leave the solar system from Earth's surface. About 16.7 km/s

> ④ Geostationary satellites

>> ○ Geostationary satellites **:** Those with an orbital period matching Earth's rotation period. Otherwise called non-geostationary satellites

>> ○ Geostationary satellites remain fixed over the same point on Earth's surface

## **3. Earth's Magnetic Field**

 ⑴ Overview **:** Earth can be considered as a magnetic dipole with its South Pole at the geographic North

 ⑵ Three Elements of Earth's Magnetism

**Figure. 7.** Three Elements of Earth's Magnetism

> ① Declination (Magnetic Azimuth) **:** Represented by α

>> ○ The angle formed by the direction of magnetic north (needle's north) with respect to true north (geographic north)

>> ○ Positive when the needle's north points east, negative when it points west

> ② Inclination **:** Represented by β

>> ○ Angle formed by the inclination of the magnetic needle to the horizontal plane. Also known as the angle between the horizontal magnetic force and the vertical magnetic force

>> ○ Magnetic dip **:** 0°, North Pole **:** +90°

>> ○ Increases with latitude

**Figure. 8.** Inclination Based on Latitude

Arrows point to the geographic North, which is the South Pole of the magnetic dipole

> ③ Horizontal magnetic force **:** Represented as A or H

>> ○ Horizontal component of Earth's magnetic force

>> ○ Maximum at the magnetic equator

>> ○ Horizontal magnetic force H = F cos I, I **:** Inclination

>> ○ Vertical magnetic force V = F sin I, I **:** Inclination

 ⑶ Variations in Earth's Magnetic Field

> ① Present Earth's magnetic field **:** 2.0 × 10-5 T

> ② Secular variation **:** Gradual change in Earth's magnetic field due to changes in Earth's interior

>> ○ No periodicity

>> ○ Normal and reversed polarity

**Figure. 9.** Magnetic Field Lines Profile during Reversed Polarity

Note: Consider that geographic North is the magnetic South

>> ○ Magnetic anomalies measured near the Wrangel Island region

**Figure. 10.** Magnetic Anomalies Measured near Wrangel Island Region

> ③ Diurnal variation **:** Variations in Earth's magnetic field due to changes in the Sun's altitude

>> ○ More prominent during daylight than nighttime

> ④ Magnetic storms **:** Sudden and rapid changes in Earth's magnetic field that occur irregularly over several hours to 2-3 days due to solar flares

>> ○ Accompanied by the phenomenon of auroras and the Van Allen belts

> ⑤ **Aurora Phenomenon** (aurora)

>> ○ Fluorescent phenomenon caused when electrons and ions previously present in solar winds excite atmospheric particles, which emit light afterward

>> ○ Electrons or ions experience a perpendicular [Lorentz force](https://jb243.github.io/pages/751#footnote_link_67_52) to their velocity and magnetic field, resulting in their spiraling path

**Figure. 11.** Trajectory of Electrons or Ions Generating Aurora

 ⑷ Causes of Earth's Magnetism and Van Allen Belts

> ① Dynamo Theory **:** Theory that currents generated by the motion of the outer core produce the Earth's magnetic field

>> ○ (Note) Circular loop of current **:** Iron ions (Fe2+) do not rotate due to Earth's rotation, so a North Pole bar magnet is not formed

>> ○ Coriolis force and convection lead to the creation of a South Pole bar magnet (considering geographic North as magnetic South)

**Figure. 12.** Actual Movement of Fe2+[Note:7]

> ② Causes of Earth's magnetic field variations

>> ○ Internal cause **:** Causes secular variation due to changes in Earth's interior

>> ○ External cause **:** Causes diurnal variation, magnetic storms, auroras, etc., due to changes in solar activity

> ③ Van Allen belts

>> ○ Belt-shaped regions that block solar winds and cosmic rays

>> ○ Inner radiation belt (Internal cause) **:** Composed mainly of protons, located at around 3,000 km above the Earth's surface

>> ○ Outer radiation belt (External cause) **:** Composed mainly of electrons, located at around 15,000 km above the Earth's surface
