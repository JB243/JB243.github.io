## **1\. Radical**

⑴ Definition: Intermediate with unpaired electrons

⑵ Stability of Radicals

> ① Stability: Phenyl Radical ＜ Vinyl Radical ＜ Methyl Radical ＜ 1° Radical ＜ 2° Radical ＜ 3° Radical ≪ Allyl Radical ＜ Benzyl Radical

> ② Higher carbon degree leads to higher stability (**∵** sp3 → sp2 electron donating inductive effect)

> ③ Allyl and benzyl radicals are stabilized through resonance, making them stable

⑶ Formation

> ① Generated through thermal (Δ) or UV (hν) homolytic reactions

>> ○ A-B → A **·** \+ **·** B

> ② Radical initiators: O-O, X-X have weak bond strength due to repulsion of non-bonding electron pairs, leading to radical formation

>> ○ Examples: X<sub>2</sub>, benzoyl peroxide, ROOR, AIBN, Ph(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Overview of Radical Reactions**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Since outer electrons are not 8, radicals are electron-deficient and highly reactive

> ② Generally do not carry a charge

> ③ **sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization**

> ④ Unlike carbon cations, no rearrangement reactions occur

> ⑤ **Propagation First Step** is rate-determining step (r.d.s)

> ⑥ Radical reactions are categorized into radical substitution and radical addition reactions, distinguishable based on reaction conditions

⑵ Carbon Radical Rearrangement

> ① Carbon cations undergo rearrangement, but carbon radicals do not

> ② Explained by molecular orbital function

>> ○ Assumption: Bonding orbital function A, antibonding orbital function B, C are given

>> ○ In the case of carbon cation, both electrons fill A

>> ○ In the case of carbon radical, 2 electrons fill A, and the remaining electron fills B or C

>> ○ In carbon cation, 1s orbital and pi bonding have the same phase → rearrangement is possible

>> ○ In carbon radical, 1s orbital and pi bonding have different phases → rearrangement is impossible

⑶ Conditions for Radical Substitution Reactions

> ① **Condition 1:** X<sub>2</sub> / hν or Δ

>> ○ X<sub>2</sub> itself is a radical initiator, using separate ROOR is wasteful

> ② **Condition 2:** NBS / hν or ROOR: NBS / Δ condition can lead to undesirable reactions apart from radical generation

<br>

> ③ **Condition 3:** NBS + HBr / hν or ROOR

>> ○ NBS reacts with HBr to produce Br<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ Br<sub>2</sub> is maintained at low concentration under this condition

<br>

**Figure. 2.** Reaction between NBS and HBr

<br>

>> ○ N-Br bond of NBS can be cleaved into N **·** \+ **·** Br bond, directly providing radicals

>> ○ NBS is usually reacted under CCl4 solution conditions: NBS exists in solid state

 ⑷ Conditions for Radical Addition Reactions

> ① **Condition 1:** HBr / hν, Δ, or ROOR

> ② **(Tip)** If HBr is a sole reactant, it's radical addition reaction; otherwise, it's radical substitution reaction

> ③ However, NBS can also be used in radical addition reactions

**Figure. 7.** Overall reaction equation

<br>

> ③ F<sub>2</sub>: Very reactive, undergoes multiple halogenation reactions

> ④ Cl<sub>2</sub>: Highly reactive

>> ○ Products: (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C-Cl (37%) + (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-CH-CH<sub>2</sub>Cl (63%)

>> ○ Highly reactive, multiple reactions can occur easily

>> ○ Carbon radical intermediate step is exothermic ( **∵** Cl2 has high energy due to non-bonding electron pair repulsion)

>> ○ Product ratio

>>> ○ 3° hydrogen substitution: 1° hydrogen substitution = 37: 63

>> ○ Number ratio

>>> ○ 3° hydrogen: 1° hydrogen = 1: 9

>> ○ Reactivity ratio

>>> ○ 3° hydrogen substitution: 1° hydrogen substitution = 37 (37 ÷ 1): 7 (63 ÷ 9)

> ⑤ Br<sub>2</sub>: Highly selective

>> ○ Products: (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C-Br (99%) + (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-CH-CH<sub>2</sub>Br (1%)

>> ○ Carbon radical intermediate step is endothermic: High activation energy leads to high selectivity

> ⑥ I<sub>2</sub>: Very selective, but low reactivity to remove hydrogen radicals

> ⑦ Reactivity of F, Cl, Br radicals based on alkyl degree

**Table. 1.** Reactivity of F, Cl, Br radicals based on alkyl degree

<br>

> ⑧ Excess Halogen: Increases the ratio of multi-substituted alkene to decrease yield of single-substituted alkene

> ⑨ Temperature Increase: Reverse reaction occurs actively, adjusting products; thermodynamically stable product becomes major product

> ⑩ **Application 1.** Chlorination of butane

>> ○ Product ratio

>>> ○ 1-chlorobutane (30%) + 2-chlorobutation (70%)

>> ○ Number ratio

>>> ○ primary hydrogen (60%) + secondary hydrogen (40%)

>> ○ Reactivity ratio

>>> ○ primary hydrogen : secondary hydrogen = 30/6 : 70/4 = 1 : 3.5

⑶ Allylic Radical Substitution Reaction

> ① If allylic radical is more stable, then radical generated will be in the allylic position

> ② **Condition 1:** X<sub>2</sub> / hν or Δ

>> ○ Competes with alkene halogen addition reaction

>> ○ Occurs well in **high temperature, low concentration, non-polar solvent**

>> ○ **Factor 1:** High temperature: ΔS ＜ 0 in addition reaction, so ΔG increases with temperature increase in ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

>> ○ **Factor 2:** Low concentration: In low concentration halogen addition reaction, probability of halonium ion formation and subsequent backside attack by halide is low

>> ○ **Factor 3:** Non-polar solvent: If solvent can't stabilize halonium ion, addition reaction rate slows down

> ③ **Condition 2:** NBS / hν or ROOR: Commonly used for allylic radical substitution reaction

> ④ **Condition 3:** NBS + HBr / hν or ROOR

>> ○ Similar to condition 1, competes with alkene halogen addition reaction

>> ○ However, Br<sub>2</sub> is maintained at low concentration in NBS + HBr, making radical substitution reaction more dominant

⑷ Benzyl Radical Substitution Reaction

> ① If benzyl radical is more stable, then radical generated will be in the benzyl position

> ② **Condition 1:** X<sub>2</sub> / hν or Δ: Possible

> ③ **Condition 2:** NBS / hν or ROOR: Possible

> ④ **Condition 3:** NBS + HBr / hν or ROOR: Possible
