## **1. Type 1.** α-Ketoglutaric acid → Glutamic acid

⑴ To remove ammonia, the reaction of α-ketoglutaric acid → glutamic acid is used

<br>

<br>

## **2. Type 2.** Glutamic acid + NH3 → Glutamine

⑴ Glutamate is converted to glutamine with the help of glutamine synthetase and ATP

⑵ Glutamate + NH4+ ⇄ Glutamine, K = 2.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup>

⑶ **Tomato and Fatigue Recovery**

> ① Over 50% of tomatoes is glutamate

> ② Glutamate converts pyruvate to alanine, which leads to less lactic acid production **:** Related to [Lactic Acid Fermentation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/70#:1.-,, -\(lacticacidfermentation)

> ③ Pyruvate is produced from the [glycolysis process](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1410) of glucose

> ④ Lactic acid is a cause of fatigue **:** Related to the lactic acid hypothesis

> ⑤ **Conclusion 1.** Tomatoes can reduce calories in the body

> ⑥ **Conclusion 2.** Consuming tomatoes reduces fatigue
