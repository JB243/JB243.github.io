## **1\. What is Chemistry?**

⑴ Chemistry: The study of matter

> ① Composition, properties, structure of matter

> ② Changes in matter

⑵ States of Matter

> ① Solid

>> ○ Has a definite shape and fixed volume

> ② Liquid

>> ○ More irregular than a solid

>> ○ Because its movements are relatively free, it has flowing properties

>> ○ It doesn't have a fixed shape and takes the shape of its container, though its volume remains constant

> ③ Gas

>> ○ More disordered than liquids

>> ○ Molecules are far apart, negligible molecular interactions

>> ○ Much lighter compared to solids or liquids of the same volume, compressible, occupies space

⑶ Classification of Matter

> ① Pure Substances: Distinguished between elements and compounds

> ② Mixtures: Classified into homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures

> ③ Elements

>> ○ Substances composed of only one type of atom

>> ○ Examples: Copper (Cu), Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), Iron (Fe), Diamond (C), Aluminum (Al)

> ④ Compounds

>> ○ Substances composed of two or more different elements in a fixed ratio

>> ○ Examples: Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), Copper Sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>), Water (H<sub>2</sub>O)

> ⑤ Homogeneous Mixtures (Solutions)

>> ○ Mixtures where multiple pure substances are uniformly distributed, composition is the same throughout

>> ○ Examples: Air, Sugar Solution, Saltwater, Alloys

> ⑥ Heterogeneous Mixtures

>> ○ Mixtures where multiple pure substances are not uniformly distributed, composition varies in different parts

>> ○ Examples: Muddy Water, Milk, Granite, Blood, Smoke

⑷ Properties of Matter

> ① Physical Properties

>> ○ Changes in state or form of matter without altering its chemical composition

>> ○ Examples: Color, Melting Point, Boiling Point, Density, Solubility, etc.

> ② Chemical Properties

>> ○ Transformation of a substance into new substances through chemical reactions

## **2. Grammar of Chemical Formulas**

⑴ Atoms, Elements, Molecules, Ions

> ① Atom: Fundamental unit in most chemical reactions. Units smaller than atoms were observed after the 1900s

> ② Element: Collection of atoms with similar characteristics

> ③ Molecule: Functional unit composed of bonded atoms

> ④ Ion: Atom with a charge due to gaining or losing electrons

> ⑤ Representation of Atoms or Ions

<br>

>> ○ a: Number of protons + Number of neutrons

>> ○ b: Number of protons

>> ○ c: Indicates charge state of X. -2, -, +, +2, etc.

>> ○ d: Indicates the number of X present

> ⑥ Isotope: Elements with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers, thus having different mass numbers

⑵ Mole

> ① Mole: Unit for counting atoms or molecules

> ② Avogadro's Number (N<sub>A</sub>): Number of atoms in one mole, defined as the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12

>> ○ N<sub>A</sub> = 6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup>

> ③ Gas Volume of 1 Mole is Constant for All Gases, at STP (0 ℃, 1 atm) it's 22.4 L

>> ○ Derived from the Ideal Gas Law

> ④ Humans are composed of around 10,000 moles

⑶ Chemical Formulas, Chemical Reaction Equations, and Reaction Yield

> ① Chemical Formula: Representation of a substance

>> ○ Empirical Formula: Simplest whole number ratio of atoms

>>> ○ Example: Empirical formula of glucose is CH<sub>2</sub>O

>> ○ Molecular Formula: Actual number of atoms in a molecule

>>> ○ Example: Molecular formula of glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>

>> ○ Determining Empirical to Molecular Formula: Mass percentage composition analysis → Empirical formula determination → Molecular formula determination (using mass spectrometry)

> ② [Structural Formula](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1355)

⑷ Stoichiometry

> ① Mass

>> ○ Atomic Weight: Relative mass of one atom. Based on <sup>12</sup>C = 12.00 as the standard (no units)

>> ○ Molecular Weight: Relative mass of one molecule. Sum of atomic weights of atoms in the molecule (no units)

>> ○ Experimental Weight: Sum of atomic weights in the experimental formula

>> ○ Average Atomic Weight: Weighted average considering the isotopic distribution. Calculation of carbon's average atomic weight is shown

<br>

> ② Concentration

>> ○ Molar Concentration: Moles of solute (mol) ÷ Volume of solution (L)

>> ○ Molal Concentration: Moles of solute (mol) ÷ Mass of solvent (kg)

>>> ○ Boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, etc.

>> ○ Mole Fraction: Moles of a specific substance (mol) ÷ Total moles in the mixture (mol), dimensionless quantity

>> ○ Mass Percent: Mass of solute (kg) ÷ Mass of solution (kg) × 100 (%)

>> ○ ppm (parts per million), ppb (parts per billion)

>>> ○ 1 ppm X = 10<sup>-6</sup> kg X / 1 kg solution

>>> ○ 1 ppb X = 10<sup>-9</sup> kg X / 1 kg solution

>> ○ ppmv (parts per million by volume), ppbv (parts per billion by volume)

>>> ○ 1 ppmv X = 10<sup>-6</sup> L X / 1 L solution

>>> ○ 1 ppbv X = 10<sup>-9</sup> L X / 1 L solution

> ③ Gram Equivalent

>> ○ The mass or molecular weight divided by the equivalent

>> ○ Represents the number of grams corresponding to 1 mole equivalent

## **3\. Chemical Reaction Equations**

⑴ Chemical Reaction Equation: Representation of chemical reactions using chemical formulas

> ① Reactant

> ② Product

> ③ Reagent: Chemical substance available for use in the laboratory

> ④ Spectator Ion: Ions indicated in the equation that do not participate in the reaction but are present

>> ○ The equation excluding spectator ions is called the net ionic equation

> ⑤ Method for Writing Chemical Reaction Equations

>> ○ **Step 1:** Represent reactants and products with chemical formulas

>> ○ **Step 2:** Skeletal equation: Write down which chemical species react

>> ○ **Step 3:** Balanced chemical equation: Calculate coefficients in the skeletal equation

>> ○ **Step 4:** Detailed chemical equation: Include states of each chemical species (e.g., _g_ , _l_ , _s_ , _aq_ ) and conditions (_e.g._, Δ, hν)

>>> ○ Gas state: (_g_)

>>> ○ Liquid state: (_l_)

>>> ○ Solid state: (_s_)

>>> ○ Aqueous solution state: (_aq_)

 ⑵ Laws of Chemical Reaction Equations

> ① Law of Conservation of Mass: Number of atoms must be conserved for all atoms, except in nuclear reactions

> ② Law of Conservation of Charge: Sum of charges in reactants equals sum of charges in products

> ③ Law of Constant Composition: Elements combine in fixed ratios

> ④ Law of Multiple Proportions: Different elements combine in whole number ratios to a fixed mass of one element

>> ○ Except when two elements form more than one compound

⑶ Coefficient Calculation in Chemical Reaction Equations

> ① For redox reactions, the reciprocal ratio of oxidation number change between oxidized and reduced species gives the coefficient ratio

>> ○ Usually, the redox reaction involves determining the coefficients for species with changing oxidation numbers, then balancing the coefficients of H2O and H+

> ② Example

>> ○ C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

>> ○ 1C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

>> ○ 1C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O (**∵** C)

>> ○ 1C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 7H<sub>2</sub>O (**∵** H)

>> ○ 1C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> + 19/2O<sub>2</sub> → 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 7H<sub>2</sub>O (**∵** O)

>> ○ 2C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> + 19O<sub>2</sub> → 12CO<sub>2</sub> + 14H<sub>2</sub>O

⑷ Limiting Reactant

> ① Substance consumed entirely in a reaction

> ② Amount of products formed is proportional to the amount of limiting reactant

 ⑸ Percentage Reaction Yield (%) = Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield × 100

> ① Reactions are not always complete due to chemical equilibrium and reverse reactions

 ⑹ Classification of Reactions

> ① All reactions involve electron movement, breaking and forming bonds

> ② Reactions with electron movement and change in oxidation number: [Redox Reactions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1346)

> ③ Reactions with electron movement but no change in oxidation number: [Acid-Base Reactions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1352). Further categorized into precipitation reactions and non-precipitation reactions
