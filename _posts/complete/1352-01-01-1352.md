## 1\. Definitions of Acids and Bases

 ⑴ Everyday Acids and Bases

> ① General Properties of Acids

>> ○ Sour Taste: Sour taste indicates a reaction with H+ ions.

>> ○ Reaction with Metals Producing Hydrogen

>> ○ pH < 7 at 25 ℃

> ② General Properties of Bases

>> ○ Bitter Taste: Bitter taste indicates a reaction with hydroxide ions.

>> ○ Slippery Feel

>> ○ pH > 7 at 25 ℃

 ⑵ Arrhenius Acid-Base Theory

> ① Acid: A substance that donates hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution.

> ② Base: A substance that donates hydroxide ions in an aqueous solution.

> ③ **Special Properties of Hydrogen**

>> ○ Hydrogen, being the lightest element, can participate in numerous chemical reactions.

> ④ Limitations

>> ○ Cannot explain substances in a non-aqueous state.

>> ○ Dissolution of NH3 in water exhibits basic properties but doesn't satisfy the Arrhenius base definition.

 ⑶ Brønsted–Lowry Acid-Base Theory

> ① Proposed simultaneously by Brønsted of Denmark and Lowry of England in 1923.

> ② Acid: Proton donor (H+ donor)

> ③ Base: Proton acceptor (H+ acceptor)

> ④ Relativity: The concepts of acids and bases are relative.

>> ○ Conjugate Base: A Brønsted–Lowry acid loses a proton to become a conjugate base.

>> ○ Conjugate Acid: A Brønsted–Lowry base gains a proton to become a conjugate acid.

>> ○ Amphiprotic: Substances like water, alcohols can act as either acids or bases under normal conditions.

> ⑤ Limitations

>> ○ Acids must include acidic hydrogen atoms.

>> ○ Substances that do not donate or accept hydrogen ions cannot be explained.

 ⑷ Lewis Acid-Base Theory: Describes all chemical reactions without oxidation state changes.

> ① Introduced by Lewis, an American physicist.

> ② Acid: Electron pair acceptor

> ③ Base: Electron pair donor, similar to nucleophiles

> ④ All Brønsted–Lowry acids are Lewis acids, but the reverse is not true.

>> ○ **Example 1:** BF3 has an empty p orbital, making it a Lewis acid but not a Brønsted–Lowry acid.

>> ○ **Example 2:** AlCl3

> ⑤ Lewis bases have a concept similar to Brønsted–Lowry bases.

> ⑥ Example: AlCl3 + NH3 → Cl3Al-NH3

>> ○ The product satisfies the octet rule more than the reactant, favoring the forward reaction.

>> ○ Lewis acid AlCl3 receives shared electron pairs from the Lewis base NH3, promoting the reaction.

 ⑸ Neutralization Reaction

> ① Reaction between acids and bases

> ② Acid-base reactions in aqueous solutions generate water and salts, releasing heat (heat of neutralization).

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Ionization Equilibrium**

 ⑴ Ionization Constant: Equilibrium constant for ionization reactions of acids and bases in aqueous solutions.

> ① Acid Dissociation Constant K<sub>a</sub>

<br>

<br>

> ② Base Dissociation Constant K<sub>b</sub>

<br>

<br>

⑵ Ionization of Water and pH

<br>

<br>

> ① For a conjugate acid-conjugate base pair, the following equation holds:

<br>

<img width="127" alt="스크린샷 2024-11-25 오후 12 06 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4523555-61a5-495a-ae78-edfa81c093b3">

<br>

> ② pH + pOH = pKw

> ③ At neutral conditions (pH = pOH = 7) at 25 ℃, Kw = 10^-14

>> ○ Water ionization is endothermic, so higher temperature increases Kw.

>> ○ With increasing temperature, neutral pH decreases.

> ④ **Useful Equation:** pK<sub>a</sub> + pKb = pKw

 ⑶ Degree of Ionization

> ① Experimental Results and Degree of Ionization

> ② Strong Acids and Strong Bases: Assumed to be 100% ionized

>> ○ Leveling Effect: Strong acids stronger than the solvent's conjugate acid and strong bases stronger than the solvent's conjugate base are all converted.

>>> ○ Stronger acids than H3O+ cannot exist in water.

>>> ○ Stronger bases than OH- cannot exist in water.

>>> ○ H2SO4 is stronger than H3O+, so it is fully converted to HSO4- in solution.

>>> ○ Dissolution of H2SO4 in water cannot undergo a reaction with H2SO4 as the reactant, except for acid-base reactions with water.

>> ○ Essence of the Leveling Effect

<br>

<img width="283" alt="스크린샷 2024-11-25 오후 12 06 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/250e55d0-5525-45e5-bc62-79453e97f3dc">

<br>

>>> ○ In the context of the leveling effect, consider HA1 as a strong acid and HA2 as H3O+.

>>> ○ Generally, the ratio of equilibrium constants is exponential, making their ratio very large or very small.

>>> ○ Since Ka1 > Ka2, Ka1 ÷ Ka2 is significantly large.

>>> ○ The third reaction has a very large equilibrium constant, so nearly 100% of it undergoes the forward reaction.

> ③ Weak Acids and Weak Bases: Assumed to be partially ionized

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka) and pK<sub>a</sub> **

 ⑴ Using pK<sub>a</sub> values to Compare Acidity and Basicity: pK<sub>a</sub> = -logKa

 ⑵ Strength of Acids and Bases

> ① Larger Ka implies stronger acids, and larger Kb implies stronger bases.

> ② Since Ka × Kb is constant, if an acid is strong, its conjugate base is weak, and vice versa.

 ⑶ ΔpK<sub>a</sub>

> ① ΔpK<sub>a</sub> > 0: Forward reaction

> ② ΔpK<sub>a</sub> < 0: Reverse reaction

> ③ ΔpK<sub>a</sub> = 0: Equilibrium state

> ④ <span>| ΔpK<sub>a</sub> |</span> ≤ 7: Equilibrium reaction between forward and reverse reactions

> ⑤ <span>| ΔpK<sub>a</sub> |</span> > 7: Unidirectional reaction between forward and reverse reactions

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Buffer Solutions**

 ⑴ Definition: Solutions that maintain a nearly constant pH upon addition of small amounts of acid or base (e.g., carbonic acid buffer action)

 ⑵ Conditions: Solutions containing a weak acid and its conjugate base can act as buffer solutions.

> ① **Method 1:** Mixing a weak acid and a stronger

 base with fewer moles

> ② **Method 2:** Mixing a weak base and a stronger acid with fewer moles

> ③ Mixing different weak acids or weak bases that are not conjugate acid-base pairs will not form buffer solutions.

>> ○ Each chemical species progresses in a way that all are either conjugate acids or conjugate bases.

>> ○ Since K = K1 ÷ K2, K is either much smaller or much larger than 1.

 ⑶ Buffer Capacity: The amount of H+ or OH- required to cause a significant change in pH in a unit volume of buffer solution.

> ① When the total amount of HA and A- is constant and only the ratio of [HA] to [A-] changes, the buffer capacity is greatest when [HA] = [A-].

>> ○ [HA] > [A-]: Buffer capacity for bases is greater than that for acids.

>> ○ [HA] < [A-]: Buffer capacity for acids is greater than that for bases.

> ② The larger the total amounts of HA and A-, the greater the buffer capacity.

> ③ Problems comparing buffer capacity with changing ratios and total amounts of [HA] and [A-] are not typically presented.

 ⑷ Buffer solutions work well when pK<sub>a</sub> - 1 < pH < pK<sub>a</sub> + 1 (i.e., pH change << 1) experimentally demonstrated.

 ⑸ Types of Buffer Solutions

> ① Carbonated Water: Mainly observed in the ocean, with pH around 8, where HCO3- is present. Since it's a divalent cation, there are two buffering ranges.

<br>

> ② Phosphoric Acid: The second most commonly observed buffering system in nature after carbonated water. Since it's a trivalent cation, there are three buffering ranges.

## **5\. Titration**

 ⑴ Titration: Experiment to measure the concentration of an unknown acid or base

> ① The titration solution should be a strong acid or base.

> ② Reason for ①: Complete neutralization should occur for accurate results.

 ⑵ Equivalence point: Point where the moles of acid (or base) within the unknown solution equal the moles of added base (or acid)

 ⑶ Indicator: Substance used to determine pH by color change

> ① End point: Also known as the pKIn where [HIn] = [In-]

>> ○ Consideration of indicator's color change range in titration experiments: pKIn - 1 ＜ Equivalence point pH ＜ pKIn \+ 1

>> ○ All indicators used in acid-base titrations are weak acids or bases according to the derived equation

>> ○ Equivalence point represents properties of the unknown reagent, while the end point represents properties of the indicator

> ② Common indicators

## **6\. Amino Acid Titration**

 ⑴ Characteristics of amino acids

> ① Isoelectric point: pH where an amino acid is uncharged. Also the point of rapid pH change.

> ② Amino acids are zwitterions at neutral pH

 ⑵ **Example 1.** Neutral Amino Acid: Glycine (gly)

> ① Amino acid with -H as the functional group

> ② Carboxyl group: pK<sub>a</sub>1 = 2.34

> ③ Amino group: pK<sub>a</sub>2 = 9.60

> ④ Isoelectric point: When [NH3+-RH2-COOH] = [NH2-RH2-COO-]

<br>

> ⑤ Interpretation of Isoelectric Point

>> ○ pH < pK<sub>a</sub>1: NH3+-RH2-COOH dominant, NH3+-RH2-COO- weak

>> ○ pK<sub>a</sub>1 ＜ pH ＜ pK<sub>a</sub>2: NH3+-RH2-COO- dominant, NH3+-RH2-COOH and NH2-RH2-COO- weak

>> ○ pK<sub>a</sub>2 ＜ pH: NH2-RH2-COO- dominant

>> ○ <b>Conclusion:</b> Once the neutral molecule is identified, find the closest pK<sub>a</sub> values before and after it, and take their average to obtain the isoelectric point (pI).

 ⑶ **Example 2.** Negatively Charged Amino Acids: Aspartic acid (Asp), Glutamic acid (Glu)

> ① Functional group pK<sub>a</sub> is greater than 2.34

> ② Isoelectric point

<br>

> ③ <b>Tip:</b> The isoelectric point (pI) can be obtained by averaging the two closest pK<sub>a</sub> values, as the pK<sub>a</sub> of the functional group (pK<sub>aR</sub>) is closer to pK<sub>a1</sub>.

 ⑷ **Example 3.** Positively Charged Amino Acids: Arginine (Arg), Histidine (His), Lysine (Lys)

> ① Functional group pK<sub>a</sub>R is less than 9.60

> ② Isoelectric point

> ① Calculating net charge at specific pH

>> ○ **Step 1.** Compare pK<sub>a</sub> values and pH for -NH3+ end, amino acid functional groups, and -COO- end, respectively.

>>> ○ -NH3+ end: pK<sub>a</sub> = 9.60

>>> ○ Glu functional group: pK<sub>a</sub> = 4.25

>>> ○ His functional group: pK<sub>a</sub> = 6.00

>>> ○ Arg functional group: pK<sub>a</sub> = 12.48

>>> ○ -COO- end: pK<sub>a</sub> = 2.34

>> ○ **Step 2.** All-or-none rule: For each amino acid, assume that the conjugate acid is present if pH &lt; pK<sub>a</sub>, and the conjugate base is present if pH > pK<sub>a</sub>.

>> ○ **Step 3.** Calculate charge for each amino acid and sum them up.

>> ○ Note that it is not necessarily +1 for a conjugate acid and -1 for a conjugate base.
