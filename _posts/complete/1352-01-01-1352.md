## 1\. Definitions of Acids and Bases

 ⑴ Everyday Acids and Bases

> ① General Properties of Acids

>> ○ Sour Taste **:** Sour taste indicates a reaction with H+ ions.

>> ○ Reaction with Metals Producing Hydrogen

>> ○ pH < 7 at 25 ℃

> ② General Properties of Bases

>> ○ Bitter Taste **:** Bitter taste indicates a reaction with hydroxide ions.

>> ○ Slippery Feel

>> ○ pH > 7 at 25 ℃

 ⑵ Arrhenius Acid-Base Theory

> ① Acid **:** A substance that donates hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution.

> ② Base **:** A substance that donates hydroxide ions in an aqueous solution.

> ③ **Special Properties of Hydrogen**

>> ○ Hydrogen, being the lightest element, can participate in numerous chemical reactions.

> ④ Limitations

>> ○ Cannot explain substances in a non-aqueous state.

>> ○ Dissolution of NH3 in water exhibits basic properties but doesn't satisfy the Arrhenius base definition.

 ⑶ Brønsted–Lowry Acid-Base Theory

> ① Proposed simultaneously by Brønsted of Denmark and Lowry of England in 1923.

> ② Acid **:** Proton donor (H+ donor)

> ③ Base **:** Proton acceptor (H+ acceptor)

> ④ Relativity **:** The concepts of acids and bases are relative.

>> ○ Conjugate Base **:** A Brønsted–Lowry acid loses a proton to become a conjugate base.

>> ○ Conjugate Acid **:** A Brønsted–Lowry base gains a proton to become a conjugate acid.

>> ○ Amphiprotic **:** Substances like water, alcohols can act as either acids or bases under normal conditions.

> ⑤ Limitations

>> ○ Acids must include acidic hydrogen atoms.

>> ○ Substances that do not donate or accept hydrogen ions cannot be explained.

 ⑷ Lewis Acid-Base Theory **:** Describes all chemical reactions without oxidation state changes.

> ① Introduced by Lewis, an American physicist.

> ② Acid **:** Electron pair acceptor

> ③ Base **:** Electron pair donor, similar to nucleophiles

> ④ All Brønsted–Lowry acids are Lewis acids, but the reverse is not true.

>> ○ **Example 1:** BF3 has an empty p orbital, making it a Lewis acid but not a Brønsted–Lowry acid.

>> ○ **Example 2:** AlCl3

> ⑤ Lewis bases have a concept similar to Brønsted–Lowry bases.

> ⑥ Example **:** AlCl3 + NH3 → Cl3Al-NH3

>> ○ The product satisfies the octet rule more than the reactant, favoring the forward reaction.

>> ○ Lewis acid AlCl3 receives shared electron pairs from the Lewis base NH3, promoting the reaction.

 ⑸ Neutralization Reaction

> ① Reaction between acids and bases

> ② Acid-base reactions in aqueous solutions generate water and salts, releasing heat (heat of neutralization).

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Ionization Equilibrium**

 ⑴ Ionization Constant **:** Equilibrium constant for ionization reactions of acids and bases in aqueous solutions.

> ① Acid Dissociation Constant Ka

> ② Base Dissociation Constant Kb

 ⑵ Ionization of Water and pH

> ① For a conjugate acid-conjugate base pair, the following equation holds:

> ② pH + pOH = pKw

> ③ At neutral conditions (pH = pOH = 7) at 25 ℃, Kw = 10^-14

>> ○ Water ionization is endothermic, so higher temperature increases Kw.

>> ○ With increasing temperature, neutral pH decreases.

> ④ **Useful Equation:** pKa + pKb = pKw

 ⑶ Degree of Ionization

> ① Experimental Results and Degree of Ionization

> ② Strong Acids and Strong Bases: Assumed to be 100% ionized

>> ○ Leveling Effect: Strong acids stronger than the solvent's conjugate acid and strong bases stronger than the solvent's conjugate base are all converted.

>>> ○ Stronger acids than H3O+ cannot exist in water.

>>> ○ Stronger bases than OH- cannot exist in water.

>>> ○ H2SO4 is stronger than H3O+, so it is fully converted to HSO4- in solution.

>>> ○ Dissolution of H2SO4 in water cannot undergo a reaction with H2SO4 as the reactant, except for acid-base reactions with water.

>> ○ Essence of the Leveling Effect

>>> ○ In the context of the leveling effect, consider HA1 as a strong acid and HA2 as H3O+.

>>> ○ Generally, the ratio of equilibrium constants is exponential, making their ratio very large or very small.

>>> ○ Since Ka1 > Ka2, Ka1 ÷ Ka2 is significantly large.

>>> ○ The third reaction has a very large equilibrium constant, so nearly 100% of it undergoes the forward reaction.

> ③ Weak Acids and Weak Bases: Assumed to be partially ionized

## **3\. Acid Dissociation Constant (Ka) and pKa **

 ⑴ Using pKa values to Compare Acidity and Basicity **:** pKa = -logKa

 ⑵ Strength of Acids and Bases

> ① Larger Ka implies stronger acids, and larger Kb implies stronger bases.

> ② Since Ka × Kb is constant, if an acid is strong, its conjugate base is weak, and vice versa.

 ⑶ ΔpKa

> ① ΔpKa > 0 **:** Forward reaction

> ② ΔpKa < 0 **:** Reverse reaction

> ③ ΔpKa = 0 **:** Equilibrium state

> ④ | ΔpKa | ≤ 7 **:** Equilibrium reaction between forward and reverse reactions

> ⑤ | ΔpKa | > 7 **:** Unidirectional reaction between forward and reverse reactions

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Buffer Solutions**

 ⑴ Definition **:** Solutions that maintain a nearly constant pH upon addition of small amounts of acid or base (e.g., carbonic acid buffer action)

 ⑵ Conditions **:** Solutions containing a weak acid and its conjugate base can act as buffer solutions.

> ① **Method 1:** Mixing a weak acid and a stronger

 base with fewer moles

> ② **Method 2:** Mixing a weak base and a stronger acid with fewer moles

> ③ Mixing different weak acids or weak bases that are not conjugate acid-base pairs will not form buffer solutions.

>> ○ Each chemical species progresses in a way that all are either conjugate acids or conjugate bases.

>> ○ Since K = K1 ÷ K2, K is either much smaller or much larger than 1.

 ⑶ Buffer Capacity **:** The amount of H+ or OH- required to cause a significant change in pH in a unit volume of buffer solution.

> ① When the total amount of HA and A- is constant and only the ratio of [HA] to [A-] changes, the buffer capacity is greatest when [HA] = [A-].

>> ○ [HA] > [A-] **:** Buffer capacity for bases is greater than that for acids.

>> ○ [HA] < [A-] **:** Buffer capacity for acids is greater than that for bases.

> ② The larger the total amounts of HA and A-, the greater the buffer capacity.

> ③ Problems comparing buffer capacity with changing ratios and total amounts of [HA] and [A-] are not typically presented.

 ⑷ Buffer solutions work well when pKa - 1 < pH < pKa + 1 (i.e., pH change << 1) experimentally demonstrated.

 ⑸ Types of Buffer Solutions

> ① Carbonated Water **:** Mainly observed in the ocean, with pH around 8, where HCO3- is present. Since it's a divalent cation, there are two buffering ranges.

> ② Phosphoric Acid **:** The second most commonly observed buffering system in nature after carbonated water. Since it's a trivalent cation, there are three buffering ranges.

> ③ Protein Buffer System

> ④ PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) **:** A buffer frequently used in chemical experiments with a pH of around 7.4.

## **5\. Titration**

 ⑴ Titration **:** Experiment to measure the concentration of an unknown acid or base

> ① The titration solution should be a strong acid or base.

> ② Reason for ① **:** Complete neutralization should occur for accurate results.

 ⑵ Equivalence point **:** Point where the moles of acid (or base) within the unknown solution equal the moles of added base (or acid)

 ⑶ Indicator **:** Substance used to determine pH by color change

> ① End point **:** Also known as the pKIn where [HIn] = [In-]

>> ○ Consideration of indicator's color change range in titration experiments **:** pKIn - 1 ＜ Equivalence point pH ＜ pKIn \+ 1

>> ○ All indicators used in acid-base titrations are weak acids or bases according to the derived equation

>> ○ Equivalence point represents properties of the unknown reagent, while the end point represents properties of the indicator

> ② Common indicators

**Table. 1.** Types of Indicators

> ③ Special indicators

>> ○ **Example 1.** Starch Indicator **:** I- doesn't color, but iodine complex (e.g., I3-) does

> ④ Principle of Indicator Color Change

>> ○ π bonds can absorb visible light **:** The normal molecular vibrational frequency is in the ultraviolet range, but with broadened resonance, it extends to visible light

>> ○ Longer conjugation leads to longer absorption wavelength

>> ○ [Absorption and observation colors based on absorption wavelength](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1404#footnote_link_67_53:~:text=%E2%91%B6-,%ED%9D%A1%EC%88%98%ED%8C%8C%EC%9E%A5%EC%97%90%20%EB%94%B0%EB%A5%B8%20%ED%9D%A1%EC%88%98%EC%83%89%2C%20%EA%B4%80%EC%B0%B0%EC%83%89,-%ED%9D%A1%EC%88%98%ED%8C%8C%EC%9E%A5%20\(nm\))
