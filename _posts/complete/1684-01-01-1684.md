## **2. Atmosphere**

⑴ Atmosphere

> ① Layer of atmosphere surrounding the Earth at about 1,000 km altitude

> ② Composed of troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere

> ③ Upper boundary of the atmosphere is not well-defined: Hydrogen is distributed up to about 10,000 km

⑵ Troposphere

> ① Extends from the surface to about 11 km

> ② Factors affecting tropospheric temperature are mainly terrestrial radiation

> ③ Temperature decreases as altitude increases due to decreasing terrestrial radiation, causing instability

> ④ Instability leads to vigorous convection movements in the atmosphere

> ⑤ Temperature lapse rate: 6.5 ℃ / km

> ⑥ Tropopause: Boundary between troposphere and stratosphere

>> ○ Tropopause height increases with lower latitudes due to vigorous convection

>> ○ Tropopause height is higher during summer than winter due to more active convection

>> ○ Equator: 17.5 km

>> ○ Mid-latitudes: 11.5 km

>> ○ Polar regions: 7.5 km

⑶ Stratosphere

> ① Presence of ozone layer: 20 ~ 30 km, 2 ~ 8 ppm

> ② Ozone layer absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun

> ③ Temperature increases with altitude due to high absorption of UV radiation: Stable atmosphere

> ④ Stability leads to the absence of convection movements

> ⑤ Absence of convection creates a stable route for prolonged aircraft flight

⑷ Mesosphere

> ① Factors affecting mesospheric temperature are mainly terrestrial radiation

> ② Temperature decreases as altitude increases due to decreasing terrestrial radiation, causing instability

> ③ Instability leads to vigorous convection movements

> ④ Despite vigorous convection, lack of water vapor prevents weather phenomena

> ⑤ Coldest region in the atmosphere

> ⑥ Almost no oxygen

⑸ Thermosphere

> ① Very high altitudes, air density is extremely low, temperature varies significantly due to space heat sources

> ② Temperature increases with altitude due to proximity to the Sun

> ③ Large temperature variation due to direct absorption of solar energy, resulting in strong diurnal changes

> ④ Aurora occurs due to external radiation

>> ○ N < C < ... < He < H

⑹ Exosphere: Spans from about 60 km to 500 km

> ① Overlaps with the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere

> ② Air molecules ionized by X-rays and ultraviolet radiation from the Sun in this region

>> ○ Ions and free electrons distributed in the atmosphere

>> ○ Bohr atom model: Electrons absorb energy and are emitted, forming ions

> ③ Divided into D, E, and F layers based on electron density

⑻ Heterosphere: Within about 80 km to 1,000 km. Gas is uneven due to sparse density and diffusion. Begins in thermosphere

**Figure 9.** Refracted Wave and Direct Wave

<br>

>>> ○ **Direct Wave:** Time taken by direct seismic wave to travel from the epicenter S to observation point D.

>>> ○ **Refracted Wave:** Time taken by seismic wave to reach point D after being refracted at the crust-mantle interface.

>>> ○ **Reflected Wave:** Always arrives later than direct wave.

>>> ○ **Cross-Over Distance:** Distance to the point where direct and refracted waves meet. Proportional to the thickness of the crust.

>>> ○ If the hypocentral distance ℓ is short, the shorter distance covered by the direct wave causes it to arrive faster at D.

>>> ○ If the hypocentral distance ℓ is long, the difference in travel distances is minimal. Depending on density differences, faster refracted waves arrive at D.

>>> ○ **Inference 1:** Mantle's P-wave velocity is faster than crustal velocity, as seismic waves refract.

>>> ○ **Inference 2:** Thicker crust results in a longer bending distance in the travel-time curve. With increased distance of the refracted wave, the time taken for it to reach the observation point is delayed.
