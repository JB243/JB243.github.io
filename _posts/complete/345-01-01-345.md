⑷ 4<sup>th</sup> Increased Temperature due to Collisions of Planetesimals, Greenhouse Effect of Water Vapor, Radioactive Decay raise Earth's temperature.

⑸ 5<sup>th</sup> Formation of Magma Ocean: Due to geological heating and radioactive element decay, the Earth's temperature increased, causing the entire planet to form a magma ocean.

⑹ 6<sup>th</sup> Formation of Core: Heavy materials like iron and nickel sink to the Earth's core from the magma ocean.

⑺ 7<sup>th</sup> Formation of Mantle: Lighter materials like silicon and oxygen rise from the magma ocean, forming the mantle.

**Figure 4.** Sidereal Month (A → B) and Synodic Month (A → C)

<br>

>> ○ Sidereal Month: The time it takes for the Moon to return to the same position relative to the stars. Approximately 27.3 days.

>> ○ Synodic Month: The time it takes for the Moon to go from one new moon to the next, or from one full moon to the next. Approximately 29.5 days.

>> ○ Reason for the difference between a Sidereal Month and a Synodic Month: Due to Earth's orbital motion around the Sun.

> ④ Moon's Rotation

>> ○ The Moon rotates on its axis from west to east, completing one rotation approximately every month.

>> ○ The Moon's rotational period is the same as its orbital period, which is why only one side of the Moon is visible from Earth.

>> ○ Reason: The Moon has lost its rotational energy to Earth through tidal interactions, settling into the lowest energy state.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3ac53da-2e56-4bb7-9764-b7c45f0ca644)

<br>

>>> ○ The synodic period of outer planets increases as they get closer to Earth and decreases as they move farther away (**∵** due to increasing angular velocity difference)

>>> ○ Synodic period of outer planets becomes close to 1 year as they move farther from Earth

>> ○ Outer planets have only gibbous phases

>> ○ Retrograde motion: Outer planets retrograde with respect to opposition (**∵** because it is close)

>> ○ Orbital plane is perpendicular to its rotational axis

>> ○ Atmospheric composition: Methane, hydrogen

> ⑦ Neptune

>> ○ Etymology: Named after the Roman god of the sea

>> ○ Not visible to the naked eye

>> ○ Atmospheric composition: Hydrogen, helium, methane, ammonia

>> ○ Bands, zones, rings present

>> ○ Triton: Satellite with an atmosphere

>> ○ Discovery of Neptune

>>> ○ Initially classified as a planet: 1781, William Herschel

>>> ○ Neptune's orbit posed a challenge to gravity theory

>>> ○ Prediction of an unknown planet: 1843, John Couch Adams

>>> ○ Discovered shortly after by German astronomers

> ⑧ Pluto

>> ○ Stripped of its planetary status by the International Astronomical Union in 2006

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Existence of similar bodies beyond the solar system

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Small size: 2/3 the size of the Moon and shrinking

>> ○ **Reason 3.** Highly elliptical orbit

## **6. Asteroids**

⑴ Most asteroids exist in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter

⑵ The total mass of all asteroids in the solar system is smaller than Earth's mass

⑶ Asteroids revolve around the Sun in a counterclockwise direction

⑷ Asteroids are important for understanding the origin of the solar system along with comets (**∵** they contain material from the early solar system)

<br>

<br>

## **7. Comets**

⑴ Definition: Celestial bodies that orbit the Sun or a massive planet in an elliptical or parabolic orbit

⑵ Structure

> ① Nucleus: Dust and ice

> ② Coma: Atmosphere

> ③ Hydrogen cloud

> ④ Tails: Ion tail, dust tail

> ⑤ Ion tail always points away from the Sun's solar wind (magnetic field)

⑶ Types: Jovian comets, Saturnian comets, Uranian comets, Neptunian comets

⑷ Period

> ① Short-period comets: Less than 20 years

> ② Halley-type comets: 20 to 200 years

> ③ Long-period comets: More than 200 years

⑸ Comets passing by Earth gain or lose energy

⑹ Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud

**Figure 8.** Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud

<br>

> ① Kuiper Belt: Region of small bodies beyond Neptune

>> ○ Doughnut-shaped region beyond Neptune, at 30 to 50 AU

>> ○ Mostly composed of icy asteroids

>> ○ Home to short-period comets

> ② Oort Cloud: Region of dust and ice fragments beyond the solar system

>> ○ Within 1 to 100,000 AU

>> ○ Domain of long-period and non-periodic comets

⑺ Comets are important for understanding the origin of the solar system along with asteroids (**∵** they contain material from the early solar system)

<br>

<br>

## **8. Meteoroids**

⑴ Definition: Tiny celestial bodies that enter Earth's atmosphere and emit light due to friction

⑵ Composition: About 30 elements including nickel, silicon, magnesium, sulfur, calcium, sodium, argon

> ① Meteor: Mainly composed of rock

> ② Meteorite: Mainly composed of iron

<br>

<br>

## **9. Lagrange Points**

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: A gravitationally stable point in the Sun's orbital plane.

> ② Discovered by Joseph Louis Lagrange in the late 18th century

⑵ Lagrange points between the Sun and Earth

**Figure 9.** [Lagrange points between the Sun and Earth](https://jb243.github.io/pages/315)

<br>

> ① L<sub>1</sub>: Ideal position for observing the Sun

> ② L<sub>2</sub>: Ideal position for space telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope

> ③ L<sub>3</sub>: Same orbit period as Earth

> ④ L<sub>4</sub>: Trojans exist. The asteroid 2010 TK7 is present near the L4 point

> ⑤ L<sub>5</sub>: Trojans exist

⑶ Lagrange points between the Sun and Jupiter

> ① Trojans exist at the L<sub>4</sub> and L<sub>5</sub> points.
