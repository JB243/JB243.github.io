 ⑵ Structure

> ① There are NPN and PNP transistors

>> ○ NPN transistor is generally considered as the reference

>> ○ PNP transistor exactly same if bias is reversed in NPN transistor

> ② BJT transistor consists of Base, Emitter, Collector

>> ○ Emitter: Part emitting charge carriers

>> ○ Collector: Part receiving charge carriers

>> ○ Emitter doping concentration is higher than Collector's

>> ○ Base is lightly doped

> ③ Charge flows from Emitter (E) → Base (B) → Collector (C)

**Figure. 1.** Symbols of NPN transistor (left) and PNP transistor (right) [Footnote:1]

>> ○ B-E junction, B-C junction can be seen as diodes

>> ○ NPN transistor symbol: Electrons move from Emitter → Base → Collector. Current is in opposite direction

>> ○ PNP transistor symbol: Holes move from Emitter → Base → Collector. Current is in the same direction

 ⑶ **Region 1:** Active Region

> ① Conditions (for NPN transistor)

>> ○ B-E junction is forward-biased

>> ○ B-C junction is reverse-biased

>> ○ Thus, VE < VB < VC

> ② Mechanism

**Figure. 2.** Operating principle of NPN transistor in active region [Footnote:2]

(Red dots represent electrons)

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> step: Forward bias applied to E-B moves electrons from Emitter to Base, forming IE

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> step: Base is lightly doped, typically 5% or less of electrons forming IE combine with holes

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> step: The remaining 95% of electrons move from Base to Collector, forming IC

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup> step: Most current flows to Collector - Collector current greatly influenced by incoming charge from Base, electric field influence low

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup> step: Similar diffusion current occurs in BJT transistor - not drift current due to electric field

>> ○ The following equations hold true

> ③ Formulation

**Figure. 3.** Analysis of B-E junction in transistor

>> ○ B-E junction: Can be seen as a diode. Density of minority carriers: Electrons more than holes

>> ○ B-C junction: Can be seen as a diode. Can be considered in equilibrium state

>> ○ Base current: Using the formula for forward-biased diode

>> ○ Collector current: Mostly diffusion current. Depends only on VBE (except for WB, the thickness of Base)

>> ○ Reason for non-zero Base current

>>> ○ Existence of holes moving from Base to Emitter to create pB-E boundary

>>> ○ Combination of electrons with holes in the Base

>> ○ Conclusion

> ④ Equivalent Circuit: B-E junction modeled as a diode with a threshold voltage. B-C junction replaced by a dependent current source

**Figure. 4.** Equivalent circuit of active region [Footnote:3]

>> ○ Dependent current source: IC = βIB

>>> ○ Typically β is an integer, not α, so β is commonly used

>>> ○ Current can only flow from Collector to Emitter, not the reverse

>>> ○ Amplification factor β varies with physical size of Base and doping density, generally around 100

>> ○ Insight: Despite large current wanting to flow through Collector, only a portion proportional to IB can enter Collector

>> ○ Continuous Base current necessary to maintain transistor in active state

>> ○ Problem-solving methodology: Calculate Base current → Collector current → Emitter current → VCE → VCB

 ⑷ **Region 2:** Saturation Region

> ① Conditions (for NPN transistor)

>> ○ B-E junction is forward-biased

>> ○ B-C junction is forward-biased

>> ○ Thus, VE, VC < VB

>> ○ If VBC < 400 mV, it's called soft saturation; if VBC > 400 mV, it's called deep saturation

> ② Similar to having forward diodes at B-E and C-E

>> ○ Internally, charge carriers gather in the Base region and saturate → Increase in Base current does not significantly change Collector current

>> ○ Threshold voltage at B-E is the same as that of a typical diode: around 0.7 V

>> ○ Threshold voltage at C-E is denoted as VCE(sat) and is around 0.2 V

>> ○ As Base terminal is narrow, C-B forward bias is same as C-E forward bias

> ③ Equivalent circuit

**Figure. 5.** Equivalent circuit of saturation region [Footnote:4]

>> ○ IC exponentially increases with VCE increase (Shockley diode model)

>> ○ Considering operating point, forward diode can be approximated as constant-voltage source and ideal diode (characteristic curve)

>> ○ VCE(sat) is constant, similar to VBE - simpl

ification of characteristic curve

>> ○ βforced defined as Collector current ÷ Base current

>> ○ βforced increases proportionally with VCE - not perfectly proportional

>> ○ When βforced increases to βdc, the current amplification ratio of the active region, transition to active region occurs

 ⑸ **Region 3:** Cutoff Region

> ① Conditions (for NPN transistor)

>> ○ B-E junction is reverse-biased

>> ○ B-C junction is reverse-biased

>> ○ Thus, VB < VE, VC

> ② Equivalent circuit

**Figure. 6.** Equivalent circuit of cutoff region

⑹ **Region 4:** Reverse Active Region (Reverse Active Area, breakdown region)

> ① Condition (NPN transistor basis)

>> ○ B-E junction is reverse biased.

>> ○ B-C junction is forward biased.

>> ○ In other words, VE > VB > VC will be true.

> ② Not commonly used region due to signal degradation.

⑺ Transistor's Current-Voltage Characteristics Curve **:** Also known as Collector's Current-Voltage Characteristics Curve

> ① Ideal transistor's current-voltage characteristics curve **:** Collector's current-voltage characteristics curve

**Figure. 7.** Transistor's Current-Voltage Characteristics Curve [Note: 6]

**Figure. 8.** Simplified Transistor's Current-Voltage Characteristics Curve [Note: 7]

**Figure. 9.** Collector Characteristic Curve Experiment and Operating Point [Note: 8]

>> ○ **Saturation Region** **:** A ~ B. In other words, when on the **line segment with a slope**

>>> ○ VB = 0.7 V

>>> ○ Keep VBB fixed and increase VCC to gradually raise VCE from 0 to 0.7 V.

>>> ○ VC = VCE < VB = 0.7, so BC junction is forward biased.

>>> ○ As VCC increases, and thus VCE increases, IC also increases gradually (Shockley Diode Model): Exponentially.

>>> ○ Increasing IB does not significantly affect IC **:** Both BE and BC junctions are forward biased, so there's no control function ( **Switch ON** )

>>> ○ In the equivalent circuit, VCE remains constant, similar to representing an actual diode as an ideal diode + voltage source. While there are practical differences in the graph, the calculated operating points are not greatly different.

>>> ○ In the equivalent circuit, IC is unrelated to IB, resulting in overlapping lines. In a real circuit, larger IB leads to smoother collector current flow.

>> ○ **Active Region** **:** B ~ C. In other words, on a **parallel line segment**

>>> ○ VB = 0.7 V

>>> ○ Increase VCC to set VCE > 0.7 V

>>> ○ VC = VCE > VB = 0.7, so BC junction is reverse biased.

>>> ○ Even with increasing VCC, IC remains constant: IC = β × IB, where β is a constant.

>>> ○ Increasing IB leads to an increase in IC.

>> ○ **Saturation Region** **:** After C. In other words, on a **line segment with a slope again**

>>> ○ If VCC keeps increasing to make the BC junction excessively reverse biased, breakdown phenomenon occurs, similar to a diode.

>>> ○ In the saturation region, the transistor is destroyed, so it should be operated at VCC < VCE(max).

>> ○ **Cutoff Region** **:** IB = 0

>>> ○ When VBB = 0 and IB = 0, increasing VCC makes both the BC and BE junctions reverse biased.

>>> ○ There exists a slight leakage current: IC ≒ 0

>> ○ Saying a BJT transistor is controlled by IB means that its characteristic curve is drawn with IB fixed.

> ② Early Effect

**Figure. 10.** Actual Transistor's Current-Voltage Characteristics Curve [Note: 9]

>> ○ Also known as Base Width Modulation Effect.

>> ○ As VCE increases, the depletion region of the collector-base reverse-biased junction increases, and the effective base thickness WB decreases.

>> ○ As a result, **collector current increases**.

>> ○ Early Voltage **:** When extending various sloped characteristic curves, they meet at a single point, the voltage at that point's **magnitude**.

> ③ Load Line and Operating Point

**Figure. 11.** Example of an Operating Point [Note: 10]

>> ○ The intersection of the characteristic curves for base current-voltage and collector current-voltage, and the load line is called the operating point (Q point).

>> ○ The base current-voltage characteristic curve is similar to a diode.

>> ○ The above current-voltage characteristic curves overlook the fact that IC is **slightly** influenced by IB in the saturation region.

⑻ Application **:** Transistor Switch

> ① Definition **:** Biasing set to oscillate between cutoff and saturation regions.

> ② Knowing the saturation voltage of the collector helps determine the minimum base current required for saturation region operation (reference: ⑼-③).

⑼ Application **:** Phototransistor

> ① Instead of connecting a conductor to the transistor's base, it's designed to allow light to induce photocurrent flow.

⑽ Summary

> ① Problem-solving should proceed in the order of **Active Region → Cutoff Region → Saturation Region**.

> ② **Approach Method 1:** Determine via voltage biasing.

**Figure. 12.** Transistor Operating Regions (Transistor Region of Operation)

> ③ **Approach Method 2:** Distinguish saturation and active regions based on the ratio of collector current to base current.

>> ○ βforced < βdc, thus the observed relationship is as follows.

>> ○ Judging the operating region based on the above relationship is **Approach Method 1** and a **necessary and sufficient condition**.

>> ○ The above relationship is also used to control saturation and active regions by attaching a current source to the base.

>> ○ The above relationship can be used to calculate the **minimum value of I** **B** **required** for operation in the saturation region.

  ⑶ **Type 1:** J-FET (Junction FET)

**Figure. 13.** Diagram and Symbol of J-FET [Note: 11]

> ① N-channel J-FET

>> ○ Applying a negative voltage to the gate causes positive holes in the P-type semiconductor to move to the edge, increasing drain current.

>> ○ Applying a positive voltage to the gate causes positive holes in the P-type semiconductor to move to the center, decreasing drain current.

**Figure. 16.** Effect of Drain Voltage Application on Channel Shape 

>> ○ **Pinch-off** phenomenon **:** Electrons in the channel move toward the drain until the channel is pinched off

**Figure. 17.** Pinch-off Phenomenon 

>>> ○ (Note) When the channel is pinched off, it means no current flows

>>> ○ (Note) Adjusting the pinch-off condition controls the current flow independently of the drain-source voltage

>>> ○ Channel Length Modulation **:** Results in increased drain current due to a shorter effective channel length

>> ○ BJT transistor's saturation region corresponds to FET transistor's unsaturated region

> ⑦ Cutoff Region

>> ○ **Condition** **:** Gate Voltage (VGS) - Threshold Voltage (VT) ＜ 0

>> ○ This condition is similar to a situation where the gate and source are reverse-biased

>> ○ Gate voltage cannot exceed E MOS-FET threshold voltage, so channel formation does not occur → No current flows
