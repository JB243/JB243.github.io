## **1\. States of Matter**

 ⑴ States of Matter **:** Generally classified into three categories. A fourth state also exists.

> ① [Gas](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1338)

> ② [Liquid](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1340)

> ③ [Solid](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1340)

> ④ Plasma State

>> ○ Definition **:** A mixture of ionized atoms or molecules in significant quantities, electrically neutral and conductive.

>> ○ Typically formed during gas discharge.

>> ○ Fourth state (e.g., fire, lightning). Ions flow like a fluid in high-temperature conditions.

>> ○ Makes up 99% of the universe.

>> ○ Used in semiconductors, LCDs, plasma display panels (PDP), nuclear fusion technology.

 ⑵ **Critical Points**

> ① Critical Temperature

>> ○ Definition **:** The maximum temperature at which a liquid can exist.

>> ○ The starting temperature for the fourth state, plasma state.

>> ○ Above this temperature, all kinetic energy is greater than the maximum intermolecular force (considering repulsion), so it can no longer be considered a fluid.

>> ○ Critical temperature of carbon dioxide is 31°C → Reason why a fire extinguisher makes sound in winter but not in summer.

> ② Supercritical Fluid

>> ○ Definition **:** State of matter at temperatures and pressures above the critical point.

>> ○ Density higher than gas but not in a liquid state.

>> ○ Exhibits properties of both gas (diffusivity) and liquid (solubility).

## **2\. Changes of State 

 ⑴ Changes of State

> ① Melting, Vaporization

> ② Fusion, Solidification

> ③ Sublimation

> ④ Dissolution

>> ○ **Example 1:** Decompression Sickness

>>> ○ Definition **:** Symptoms that can lead to death or other conditions when scuba divers ascend too quickly after diving.

>>> ○ Cause **:** Underwater pressure causes gases to dissolve in the bloodstream, which can come out of solution and form bubbles as the diver ascends.

>>> ○ **Prevention 1:** Ascend slowly at 10-20 m/min.

>>> ○ **Prevention 2:** Use specialized equipment.

 ⑵ Boiling Point

> ① Increase in Intermolecular Forces → Increase in Boiling Point

> ② Surface Area **:** Longer carbon chains and fewer substituents lead to increased intermolecular forces → higher boiling point.

> ③ Polarizability **:** Higher polarizability (larger atomic radius, larger surface area) leads to increased intermolecular forces → higher boiling point.

 ⑶ Freezing Point **:** Also known as the solidification point

> ① Increase in Intermolecular Forces → Higher Freezing Point

> ② Surface Area **:** Longer carbon chains and fewer substituents lead to increased intermolecular forces → higher freezing point.

> ③ Symmetry **:** Higher energy required to convert from solid to liquid due to better stacking in crystalline lattice because of symmetry.

>> ○ Example **:** Trans fat

 ⑷ Heat Entry and Exit during Phase Changes

> ① Sensible Heat **:** Heat that causes a change in temperature.

> ② Latent Heat **:** Heat absorbed or released without a change in temperature during a state change.

> ③ Latent Heat of Water

>> ○ Heat of Fusion = 80 kcal/kg

>> ○ Heat of Vaporization = 539 kcal/kg

 ⑸ Gel-Sol Transition in Solids **:** Important in [Polymer Synthesis](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1399)

## **3\. Phase Diagram**

 ⑴ Phase Diagram of Water

**Figure 2.** Phase Diagram of Water

> ① Triple Point of Water **:** 0.009 ℃, 4.58 mmHg

> ① **Solid-Liquid Slope** **:** While most substances have a positive slope, water has a negative slope.

>> ○ Tin with four phases exhibits a similar behavior.

>> ○ Feature **:** Generally, an increase in pressure leads to an increase in melting point, but water's melting point decreases with pressure.

>> ○ Cause **:** Expansion during solidification.

> ② Water Density Comparison

>> ○ Near 0 ℃, water has higher density than ice.

>> ○ Sudden increase in density when ice transforms into water.

>> ○ Around 4 ℃, the hexagonal crystal structure of ice has the maximum number of hexagons, resulting in maximum density.

> ③ Phase Equilibrium Diagram of Ice **:** Distorted hexagons → Increased density

 ⑵ Phase Diagram of Carbon

> ① Carbon has four phases.

> ② Density Comparison **:** Diamond > Graphite > Liquid > Gas
