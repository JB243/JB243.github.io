**Q.** Find the number of ways to make a given number by summing up at least two consecutive natural numbers. For example,

> 15 = 7 + 8 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

> There are a total of four methods.

<br>

<br>

**Lemma.**

> Let N be the given number, N = a × b, a = 2k form, and 2 does not divide b. Then, the number of ways demanded in the problem is equal to the number of divisors of b.

<br>

<br>

**Proof.**

> Consider adding n to k natural numbers.

> In this case, it can be seen that k is a divisor of 2N.

> For any divisor k of 2N, let n be defined, and the following condition is necessary and sufficient.

> Since 2n + k - 1 and k have different parities, if one side is an odd divisor of 2N, the other side is an even divisor. (Second condition)

> First, let's ignore the condition 2n + k - 1 > k and think about it.

> 2n + k - 1 can be even and k can be odd, or 2n + k - 1 can be odd and k can be even.

> (Note that 2N is even.)

> In each case, it can be easily confirmed that the number of ways is equal to the number of divisors of b.

> However, since 2n + k - 1 and k have different parities, they cannot be equal.

> Also, since 2n + k - 1 and k are symmetrical, the number of cases where 2n + k - 1 > k and k > 2n + k - 1 is the same.

> Therefore, considering 2n + k - 1 > k, we have the following:
