## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Photoelectron Spectroscopy: Observing electron transitions by X-rays

⑵ Raman Spectroscopy: Emitting visible light lasers and observing changes in wavelength

⑶ Infrared Spectroscopy: Observing molecular vibrations by infrared. Observing how much the same wavelength of infrared is observed after irradiating infrared

⑷ Microwave Spectroscopy: Observing molecular rotations by microwaves

⑸ Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: Observing nuclear spin transitions by radio waves

⑹ Here are some tips for solving spectroscopy problems:

> ① **Consider the [Degree of Unsaturation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1356#3-degree-of-unsaturation-ihd-index-of-hydrogen-deficiency) First**: If the degree of unsaturation is 4 or higher, the presence of a benzene ring is strongly suspected.

> ② **Focus on <sup>1</sup>H [NMR](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1404#5-nuclear-magnetic-resonance-nmr-spectroscopy)**: It's recommended to solve problems primarily using 1H NMR, as it can be approached like solving a math problem and provides a substantial amount of information.

> ③ **Use the Chemical Formula to Narrow Down Possibilities**: It's advisable to deduce possible structures based on the given chemical formula.

> ④ **Utilize Symmetry**: Taking advantage of symmetry can make solving problems significantly easier.

> ⑤ **Differentiate cis/trans Alkenes with 1H NMR**: The cis/trans isomers of alkenes can be distinguished using <sup>1</sup>H NMR.

> ⑥ **Chemical Shifts of Hydrogens on the Same Carbon**: Hydrogens attached to the same carbon can have different chemical shift values (ppm) in <sup>1</sup>H NMR depending on their spatial arrangement.

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. entrance region

>> ○ **1-1.** Sample molecules are introduced: Molecules are mostly neutral

>> ○ **1-2.** Molecules pass through metal plates with positive potential

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. ionization region

>> ○ **2-1.** In a mass spectrometer, electrons with an energy of 70 eV are emitted through an electron beam.

>> ○ **2-2.** Ionization stage: Organic molecules colliding with high-energy electrons lose one electron and form molecular ions

>>> ○ Mass of molecular ion = Molecular weight

>>> ○ Molecular ion takes radical form: Can be expressed as M<sup>+ㆍ</sup>

>> ○ **2-3.** Fragmentation: Molecular ions are very unstable, breaking into radical parts and positively charged parts

>>> ○ Preferred fragmentation reactions exist depending on the functional groups

>>> ○ Fragmentation of polypeptides: b represents a fragment with NH2 at the end, and y represents a fragment with -COOH at the end

<br>

>>> ○ When two peaks differ exactly by 28 Da, it is estimated to be an a-b pair or an x-y pair

>>> ○ The a ion appears less frequently than the b ion: C≡O<sup>+</sup> is more unstable than C=N<sup>+</sup>

>> ○ **2-4.** Generation of 1+, 2+ ions, etc.: Generally, 1+ ions are formed

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. acceleration region

>> ○ **3-1.** The electric field is formed due to the metal plates, each with zero and negative potential, along with the metal plate in the front with positive potential.

>> ○ **3-2.** Positively charged molecules are accelerated according to the electric field

>> ○ Only positively charged chemical species reach the recorder

<br>

<br>

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. drift region

>> ○ Positively charged molecules move in a straight line in the drift region where there is no electric field when passing through metal plates with negative potential

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. detector region

>> ○ **Type 1:** Reflectron mode: See **Figure 1.**

>>> ○ Principle: [Lorentz Force](https://jb243.github.io/pages/751)

>>> ○ Ion passage through a magnetic field allows different arrival times at the detector depending on m/z

>> ○ **Type 2:** Linear mode

>>> ○ Notably, quadruple mass spectrometry (QMS) is available

>>> ○ QMS provides oscillating electric field through RF to allow different arrival times at the detector depending on m/z

>> ○ **Principle 1:** Time-of-Flight (TOF) Mass Analyzer

>>> ○ Utilizes the principle that ions of different masses take different times to reach the detector based on m/z

>>> ○ Smaller ions reach the detector faster than larger ions

>> ○ **Principle 2:** Liquid Chromatography (LC) Analyzer

>> ○ Specific m/z can be selectively accepted, not the entire m/z (e.g., MS/MS)

>> ○ A single substance can produce multiple ions, thus having multiple m/z values: Deconvolution algorithm creates a single peak

⑵ Interpretation of Mass Analysis

> ① The highest peak in mass analysis is called the base peak

> ② The base peak is set as 100, and the others are measured as relative values

> ③ Example of m/z: The more stable the positive chemical species, the larger the peak

**Figure 4.** Example of m/z 

<br>

> ④ Nitrogen rule

>> ○ Hydrocarbons composed of C, H, O elements always have even molecular weights, so molecular ions are even

>> ○ If an odd-numbered molecular ion is observed in organic molecules, it can be assumed to contain an odd number of nitrogen atoms

>> ○ Example: The odd m/z in the example above is due to not considering proton transfer (refer to MALDI-TOF)

>>> ○ CH<sub>4</sub>: 16

>>> ○ C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>: Even

>>> ○ C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>: Even

>>> ○ C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub>: Even

>>> ○ When substituting -H with -OH, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -SH, -SiH<sub>3</sub> groups: Even

>>> ○ When substituting -H with -NH<sub>2</sub> group: Odd

> ⑧ **Factor 2:** Smaller atoms have less electron dispersion, leading to increased wavenumbers

> ⑨ **Factor 3:** Larger dipoles indicate stronger bonds, leading to increased wavenumbers

>> ○ O-H ＞ N-H ＞ C-H

## **5\. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy**

⑴ Principle

> ① Chemical species with nonzero spin quantum numbers like <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P can be studied using NMR.

> ② Such chemical species exhibit quantized states when subjected to an external magnetic field.

> ③ The electromagnetic waves corresponding to energy differences between these states are radiofrequency waves.

> ④ Information obtained through NMR: Type and number of specific chemical species.

> ⑤ Voxel size in MRI is generally 1 × 1 × 5 mm³, while in MRS it is larger at 15 × 15 × 15 mm³.

⑵ <sup>1</sup>H NMR (Proton NMR)

> ① <sup>1</sup>H possesses two quantized states with respect to the magnetic field B<sub>0</sub>: α-spin state and β-spin state.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/d4db1343-3094-4e12-b74f-278ad91d6f6e)

**Figure 21.** Two quantized states with respect to the magnetic field

<br>

> ② Spin flip: When <sup>1</sup>H absorbs energy proportional to the magnetic field strength, it transitions from the α-spin state to the β-spin state.

> ③ **Principle 1.** Integral ratio

>> ○ Integral ratio of NMR signals represents the ratio of equivalent 1H nuclei.

>> ○ Reason: Signal is linearly proportional to the number of equivalent 1H nuclei. Other factors have minimal influence.

> ④ **Principle 2.** Chemical shift

>> ○ **Lenz's Law**: When there's a change in the external magnetic field, electrons induce a magnetic field in the opposite direction to cancel it.

>> ○ **Chemical shielding**: Local magnetic field change proportionate to the intrinsic magnetic field B0.

<br>

<br>

>>> ○ B<sub>i</sub>: Local magnetic field

>>> ○ σ<sub>i</sub>: Shielding factor reflecting the shielding effect on proton i

>>> ○ Shielding factors are generally small (10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup>), so magnetic field differences are very small.

>>> ○ Using ratios instead of absolute values to reflect magnetic field differences

>>> ○ Calculation of exponent: The difference between local magnetic field and reference frequency divided by the reference frequency. Commonly expressed in ppm units.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/1ed535ef-a6d3-4424-8ae4-7b9de6ba598b)

<br>

>>>> ○ This term representing the magnetic field difference is called chemical shift.

>>>> ○ The value of ω<sub>ref</sub> is arbitrary but often chosen as ω<sub>TR</sub> of the transmitter.

>>>> ○ Main advantage: Independent of B<sub>0</sub>

>>>> ○ **Example:** In a 300 MHz <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, acetone exhibits a single resonance line with a chemical shift δ of 2.0 ppm with reference to tetramethylsilane (TMS). How many Hz away from TMS is this acetone's resonance line? **600 Hz**

>> ○ Protons in an electron-deficient environment experience a strong external magnetic field, resulting in higher resonance frequency and larger δ value.

>>> ○ Protons in an electron-deficient environment are called deshielded protons or downfield protons.

>>> ○ Associated with the deshielding effect

>> ○ Protons in an electron-rich environment experience a weaker external magnetic field, leading to lower resonance frequency and smaller δ value.

>>> ○ Protons in an electron-rich environment are called shielded protons or upfield protons.

>>> ○ Associated with the shielding effect

>> ○ Protons closer to atoms with high electronegativity experience more deshielding, resulting in larger δ values.

>>> ○ Example: In C<span style="color: red;">H</span><sub>3</sub>C<span style="color: blue;">H</span><sub>2</sub>C<span style="color: green;">H</span><sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, δ for <span style="color: red;">H</span> is 1.04 ppm, δ for <span style="color: blue;">H</span> is 2.07 ppm, δ for <span style="color: green;">H</span> is 4.37 ppm.

>>> ○ Example: Methyl proton at 0.85 ppm, methylene proton at 1.20 ppm, methine proton at 1.55 ppm.

> ⑤ **Principle 3.** Spin-Spin Splitting

>> ○ NMR signals of a particular <sup>1</sup>H are split into multiple signals due to its neighboring equivalent <sup>1</sup>H nuclei.

>> ○ **Background 1.** Each neighboring <sup>1</sup>H can adopt one of two spin states: α-spin state or β-spin state.

>> ○ **Background 2.** The state of each neighboring <sup>1</sup>H affects the NMR signal of the specific <sup>1</sup>H.

>> ○ _ortho_ hydrogen > _meta_ hydrogen > _para_ hydrogen in terms of splitting influence: Increasing influence as they get closer

<br>

**Figure 22.** Spin-Spin Splitting Constants according to Hydrogen Orientation

<br>

>> ○ When only _ortho_ hydrogens are present

>>> ○ NMR signal from that <sup>1</sup>H is split into a total of n+1 signals, and the relative sizes of the kth signal are proportional to binomial coefficients <sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub>.

>>> ○ Depending on the number of splittings, signals are classified as singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, quintet, sextet, septet, octet, nonet, etc.

> ⑥ Actual <sup>1</sup>H NMR

>> ○ TMS (tetramethylsilane): Used as a reference substance, its signal is set to 0 ppm.

>> ○ δ values of other <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals are expressed relative to TMS.

<br>

>>> ○ **Reason 1.** High frequency values

>>> ○ **Reason 2.** δ values are independent of the magnetic field (because frequency is proportional to the magnetic field)

>> ○ Examples of chemical shifts: Benzene hydrogen = 6.5-8, aldehyde hydrogen = 9.0-10

**Figure 26.** Difference between FTIR (above) and Raman spectroscopy (below)

<br>

⑵ Inelastic Scattering: Also known as Raman scattering

> ① Definition: Scattering with energy change. Incident and scattered wavelengths are different.

> ② Raman shift is used to denote how much the wavelength has shifted from Rayleigh scattering.

>> ○ Unlike IR spectroscopy, it doesn't directly measure vibrational energy.

>> ○ Raman shift is measured in cm<sup>-1</sup>.

> ③ Quantum mechanical understanding: Energy difference before and after Raman scattering corresponds to molecular vibrational energy.

>> ○ When a molecule gains energy, it's called Stokes scattering.

>> ○ When a molecule loses energy, it's called anti-Stokes scattering.

>> ○ Stokes scattering is generally more prominent than anti-Stokes scattering because ground state molecules outnumber vibrationally excited molecules.

⑷ Spectroscopic Process

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Monochromatic light is directed onto the sample.

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Both Raman-scattered light and Rayleigh-scattered light pass through a notch filter, mostly containing Rayleigh scattering.

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. The notch filter selectively blocks Rayleigh-scattered light.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Raman-scattered light that passes through the notch filter is separated by a grating based on its wavelength.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. The specific wavelength Raman-scattered light is read by a CCD.

⑸ Using visible light on human skin results in strong fluorescence, making it difficult to observe Raman scattering spectra.
