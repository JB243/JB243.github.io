<br>

> ○ **Solution**

>> ○ (Note) Since 242 = 35 - 1, this implies that the bricks should be divided into thirds rather than halves.

>> ○ (Note) When dividing the bricks into n parts and placing only 2 parts on a balance scale, the greater the n, the greater the benefit but also the greater the risk.

>> ○ (Reference) The locations marked with an asterisk (*) indicate defective bricks.

>> ○ Dividing into halves and placing on a balance scale, you can identify the defective brick in **8 uses**.

>>> ○ 242* → 142* + 142 (1st use)

>>> ○ 142* → 81* + 81 (2nd use)

>>> ○ 81* → 40* + 40 + 1 (3rd use) **:** Compare two bundles of 40

>>> ○ 40* → 20* + 20 (4th use)

>>> ○ 20* → 10* + 10 (5th use)

>>> ○ 10* → 5* + 5 (6th use)

>>> ○ 5* → 2* + 2 + 1 (7th use) **:** Compare two bundles of 2

>>> ○ 2* → 1* + 1 (8th use)

>> ○ Dividing into thirds and placing on a balance scale, you can identify the defective brick in **5 uses**.

>>> ○ 242* → 81* + 81 + 80 (1st use) **:** Compare two bundles of 81

>>> ○ 81* → 27* + 27 + 27 (2nd use) **:** Compare two bundles of 27

>>> ○ 27* → 9* + 9 + 9 (3rd use) **:** Compare two bundles of 9

>>> ○ 9* → 3* + 3 + 3 (4th use) **:** Compare two bundles of 3

>>> ○ 3* → 1* + 1 + 1 (5th use) **:** Compare one by one on the balance scale

>> ○ When divided into quarters and placed on the balance scale, the result is not significantly different from dividing into halves.

>> ○ Dividing into fifths or sixths increases the risk too much, reducing the expected utility in the worst-case scenario.

>> ○ Answer **:** 5 times

**Problem 30.** **** On an island, there are 50 people. Each of them has a dog, and they all gather in the square every afternoon before dispersing to their homes. One night, a wizard appears and casts the following three spells:

⑴ Some of the 50 dogs instantly become infected with rabies.

⑵ The owner of an infected dog cannot tell if their dog has rabies (However, they can tell if other people's dogs are rabid).

⑶ From the moment the spell is cast, the residents can no longer speak.

⑷ Only the owner can kill a dog infected with rabies.

⑸ The residents are aware of the effects of spells ⑴ to ⑷, and know that all the rabies-infected dogs must be killed for the spells to be lifted.

Since a rabies-infected dog could harm others at any time, and the 50 island residents value life highly, they start observing each other's dogs from the day after the wizard's visit, to only kill the rabid ones. When an owner is certain their dog has gone mad, they return home and kill it.

On the fourth day after the wizard's visit, after the residents gather and disperse in the square, all the mad dogs are killed that night. They are then able to speak again and are certain there are no more mad dogs. How many mad dogs were there?

Until the fourth gathering of the residents, no dogs had been killed. All the mad dogs are killed on the same day.

<br>

**Solution 30.**

> ○ **Case 1.** If there is 1 rabid dog

>> ○ On the first day after the wizard's visit, the owner of the rabid dog sees no other mad dogs.

>> ○ Since the residents are still under the spell, the owner quickly realizes their dog has rabies.

>> ○ Therefore, all mad dogs are killed that night.

> ○ **Case 2.** If there are 2 rabid dogs

>> ○ On the first day after the wizard's visit, the owner of each rabid dog sees 1 other mad dog.

>> ○ However, they realize that no mad dogs were killed even on the second day after the wizard's visit.

>> ○ Thus, the owners quickly realize their own dogs are also rabid.

>> ○ Therefore, all mad dogs are killed that night.

> ○ Mathematical Induction

>> ○ If there are k rabid dogs, there are no deaths until the kth day after the wizard's visit, and all die that night (1 ≤ k ≤ n) (※)

>> ○ If there are (n+1) rabid dogs, assume no dogs die until the (n+1)st day after the wizard's visit.

>> ○ In this case, the owners of the rabid dogs are certain of their dogs' condition and kill them that night.

>> ○ Thus, (※) still holds true even for k = (n+1).

>> ○ Note, the owner of a rabid dog sees n dogs, so they try to kill their dog after the night of the (n+1)st day, but the owner of a healthy dog sees (n+1) dogs, so they attempt to kill their dog after the (n+2)nd day → There is no case of mistakenly killing a healthy dog.

>> ○ Therefore, (※) always holds true.

> ○ Answer **:** There are 4 rabid dogs.

**Problem 31.** A census taker visits a house for a survey and has the following conversation with the parents.

▷ Parents **:** We have three daughters, and the product of their ages is 36.

▷ Census Taker **:** I don't understand.

▷ Parents **:** The sum of their ages is the same as our house number.

▷ Census Taker **:** (After checking the house number) I still don't understand.

▷ Parents **:** Well, let me call our eldest daughter, then you can guess.

▷ Census Taker **:** No, now I know their ages.

How did the census taker figure out the ages of the three daughters, and what are their ages?

<br>

**Solution 31.**

> ○ Possible ages where the product is 36 (sum in parentheses):

>> ○ 1 × 1 × 36 (38)

>> ○ 1 × 2 × 18 (21)

>> ○ 1 × 3 × 12 (16)

>> ○ 1 × 4 × 9 (14)

>> ○ 1 × 6 × 6 (13)

>> ○ 2 × 2 × 9 (13)

>> ○ 2 × 3 × 6 (11)

>> ○ 3 × 3 × 4 (10)

> ○ There are duplicate sums: (1, 6, 6) and (2, 2, 9).

> ○ The eldest daughter is unique: Thus, (1, 6, 6) is not the correct solution.

> ○ Answer **:** The ages of the daughters are 2, 2, and 9 years.

**Problem 32.** Here are several pieces of string that appear identical. When one end of a string is lit, it burns unevenly but always takes exactly 1 minute to burn completely. Use these strings to measure exactly 45 seconds.

<br>

**Solution 32.**

> ○ If both ends of a string are lit, it will burn out in 30 seconds.

. ○ Lay two strings side by side, light one end of one string and both ends of the other.

> ○ When the string with both ends lit burns out, light the other end of the first string. This will total 30 seconds + 30 seconds / 2 = 45 seconds.

**Problem 35.** (Webtoon Kill the King: Flaw Game) Choose one of the flipped cards to replace with the King card. The number of the card I choose becomes the 'location where the King card is hidden'. The starting player cannot choose cards from the 'Penalty Zone (26 ~ 33)'. Players take turns asking 'questions' to find out where the other player has hidden the King card. The winner is the one who finds out the location first. Questions must be answerable with 'Yes' or 'No'. (Note: 'Penalty Zone' refers to a zone exclusive to the player playing second.)

First, it is necessary to properly understand the rules of the game. Let's assume the starting player is certain that one of two cards contains the opponent's King card. According to the rules stated above, the starting player would know the location of the opponent's King card with just one question, which seems to make the starting player the winner. However, according to the content in the webtoon, this is not the case. Therefore, the condition for victory is not whether one knows the location of the King card, but whether one has correctly 'identified' the location. Then, it can be understood that there are two types of questions: 'guessing' the location of the King card and 'identifying' it.

To narrow down the range of the King card with one question, it is ideal to split the combinations into those with and without the King card, which the webtoon introduces as the 'Half and Half Strategy'.

In the webtoon, the male lead mentions that if the starting player uses 24 cards and the second player uses 32 cards, making a total of 56 cards, both sides have a 50% chance of winning. He inferred that this awkward rule must have some kind of 'flaw'. Then, where did the male lead get the conclusion that using 56 cards results in a 50% winning rate?
