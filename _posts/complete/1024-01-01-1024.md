**Q.** Enzyme A is deactivated by oxygen molecules at 50 ℃, and the inactive rate constant k1, which becomes inactive form (D), is 0.002 / M·s. On the other hand, the enzyme reversibly undergoes a form change and partially unfolds into an unstable unfolded form (N'). It becomes more sensitive to oxygen and eventually loses its activity, and the inactive rate constant k2 from the unfolded form is 0.3 / M·s. Meanwhile, the apparent inactive rate constant kobs for oxygen of enzyme A at 50 ℃ at 0.05 / M·s.

⑴ What is the equilibrium constant between native form (N) and unfolded form (N')?

⑵ What would be the inert rate constant if there was a reaction substrate of enzyme A in the above experiment?

⑶ Explain measures to increase enzyme productivity. 

> ① First, optimal pH, optimal temperature, optimal ion gradient (e.g. **:** Forms chelate ions). 

> ② Second, increase the stability of the enzyme by adding a substrate or similar substrate to the enzyme. (See ⑵)
