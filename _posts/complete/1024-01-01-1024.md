## **Q.** 

Enzyme A loses its activity at 50℃ due to oxygen molecule, converting into an inactive form (D). The inactivation rate constant, k<sub>1</sub>, is 0.002 / M·s. On the other hand, the enzyme reversibly undergoes a form change and partially unfolds into an unstable unfolded form (N'). It becomes more sensitive to oxygen and eventually loses its activity, and the inactive rate constant k<sub>2</sub> from the unfolded form is 0.3 / M·s. Meanwhile, the apparent inactivation rate constant (k<sub>obs</sub>) of enzyme A with respect to oxygen at 50 ℃ was measured to be 0.05 / M·s.

<br>

⑴ What is the equilibrium constant between native form (N) and unfolded form (N')?

⑵ What would be the inactivation rate constant if there was a reaction substrate of enzyme A in the above experiment?

⑶ Explain the measures to improve the productivity of an enzyme.

> ① First, establish optimal pH, temperature, and ion gradients (e.g., chelate ions).

> ② Second, enhance the stability of the enzyme by adding substrates or substrate analogs.
