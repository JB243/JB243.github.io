## **1. Structure of Teeth**

 ⑴ Chemical Composition

> ① Teeth have a denser crystal structure than bones and lower moisture content.

 ⑵ Tooth = Crown + Root

> ① Crown: The visible part outside the gum.

> ② Root: The part within the gum.

 ⑶ Tooth Tissues = Enamel + Dentin + Pulp

> ① **Enamel:** The outermost layer of the tooth.

>> ○ 96% of enamel is composed of hydroxyapatite, a mineral crystal.

>> ○ Hardest tissue in the human body, harder than bones.

>> ○ Can withstand forces of 60 kg to 70 kg.

>> ○ Avascular tissue. Non-living tissue.

> ② **Dentin:** The main bulk of the tooth, under the enamel.

>> ○ 70% of dentin is composed of hydroxyapatite, a mineral crystal.

>> ○ Dentinal tubules: Microscopic holes in dentin.

>> ○ Function: Absorbs mechanical shocks to enamel (acts as a cushion).

>> ○ Odontoblasts: Cells in dentin. Synthesize dentin, extend into dentinal tubules.

>> ○ Vascular tissue. Living tissue due to odontoblasts.

>> ○ (Note) Factors in dentin formation: OP-1 (osteogenic protein), BMP-2, BMP-4.

> ③ Dental Pulp

>> ○ Mature teeth can survive without dental pulp. Reason for root canal therapy.

>> ○ Core: Fibroblasts + GAG + collagen. Contains blood vessels and nerves. Supplies nutrients and detects stimuli.

>> ○ Periphery: Presence of odontoblasts. Dentin formation and repair when dentin is damaged.

 ⑷ Gingiva (Gums): Tissues around the teeth

> ① **Cementum:** Tissue surrounding the tooth root.

>> ○ 50% of cementum is composed of hydroxyapatite, a mineral crystal.

>> ○ Anchors collagen fibers of the periodontal ligament to the tooth.

>> ○ Composed of hydroxyapatite, protein, collagen.

> ② Alveolar Bone: Bone supporting teeth

>> ○ Contains osteoblasts on its surface.

> ③ Gingiva: Pink mucous membrane beneath the crown of the tooth.

>> ○ Protects alveolar bone.

> ④ Periodontal Ligament: Thin membrane connecting cementum and alveolar bone.

>> ○ Function: Cushions impact. Implants without this ligament can't absorb shocks.

>> ○ Composed of fibroblasts.

>> ○ Contains blood vessels and nerves.

>> ○ Tension on the ligament → ligament cells differentiate into osteoblasts → alveolar bone formation.

>> ○ Loss of function leads to alveolar bone resorption.

## **2. Tooth Growth**

 ⑴ Number of Teeth = 4 × (Incisors × 2 + Canines × 1 + Premolars × 2 + Molars × 3) = 32

 ⑵ Timing of Tooth Eruption

**Table 1.** Timing of Tooth Eruption

<br>

 ⑶ (Note) Tooth Growth from Birth to Adulthood

> ① Birth: Deciduous and some permanent teeth present but not visible.

> ② 6 to 8 months: First tooth erupts, usually lower central incisors.

> ③ 2.5 years: All 20 deciduous teeth present.

> ④ 6 to 8 years: First permanent molars appear, followed by permanent incisors.

> ⑤ 10 years: Premolars and canines erupt after incisors.

> ⑥ 12 years: Second permanent molars appear.

> ⑦ 17 to 21 years: Third molars (wisdom teeth) erupt. (Origin) Eruption coincides with the time of falling in love.

## **3. Dental Diseases**

 ⑴ Gingivitis (Gum Inflammation): Inflammation of gum tissue

> ① Cause: Plaque (bacterial colony)

>> ○ Plaque: Bacterial mass in the oral cavity

>> ○ Plaque bacteria survive on carbohydrates from food.

>> ○ Plaque → Invades periodontal tissues (gingivitis) → Turns into tartar (calculus).

> ② Gingivitis can occur even in a healthy body. Plaque needs physical removal, not just immunity.

 ⑵ Dental Caries (Tooth Decay)

> ① 85% of the general population has it.

> ② Cause

>> ○ Carbohydrates + Plaque → Acid formation

>> ○ Acid + Tooth → Decay: Acid dissolves minerals.

>> ○ Streptococcus mutans: Forms dextran from carbohydrates. Dextran is essential for plaque formation.

> ③ Stages

>> ○ Grade 1 Dental Caries: Limited to enamel. Remove decay and fill with amalgam or gold.

>> ○ Grade 2 Dental Caries: Reached dentin. Remove decay and fill with amalgam or gold.

>> ○ Grade 3 Dental Caries: Reached the pulp. Root canal therapy + (if necessary) extraction.

 ⑶ Oral Cancer: Malignant tumor in the oral cavity and surrounding tissues

> ① 5% of all cancers. 7th to 8th leading cause of cancer-related deaths.

> ② Causes: Smoking, alcohol consumption, poor oral hygiene, syphilis virus, drugs, weakened immune function, oral mucosal irritation.

> ③ Treatment: Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy
