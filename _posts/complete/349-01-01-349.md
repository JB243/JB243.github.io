## **1. Shape of the Earth**

 ⑴ Ancient People's Perceptions of the Earth's Shape

> ① Ancient people thought the Earth was flat, believing there were cliffs at the edge of the world.

> ② Sumerians believed in a round celestial dome on a flat, disk-shaped Earth.

> ③ Indians thought that a turtle and an elephant supported the Earth.

> ④ Ancient Egyptians believed it was constructed by gods.

 ⑵ Ellipsoid

> ① The actual shape of the Earth **:** an oblate spheroid with bulging at the equator.

> ② Evidence of Earth's roundness

>> ○ Sunrise times get earlier as one travels east.

>> ○ "During a lunar eclipse, the shadow cast on the Moon is round." - Aristotle

>> ○ Magellan's successful circumnavigation proved the possibility of returning to the original position by continuous sailing.

>> ○ Ships approaching from the sea to a port become visible from the mast first, while ships moving away from the coast disappear from the bottom.

>> ○ Constellations visible vary with latitude.

>> ○ Polaris (North Star) appears higher above the horizon as latitude increases.

> ③ Evidence of Earth's oblateness

>> ○ Distance between two points at latitude 1° increases as latitude goes higher.

>> ○ Clocks with pendulums run faster at higher latitudes, indicating an increase in gravitational force.

> ④ Reason for Earth's oblateness **:** Due to the centrifugal force (inertia) caused by Earth's rotation.

> ⑤ Flattening

>> ○ Flattening parameter e: e = 0 for a sphere, 0 < e < 1 for an ellipsoid, e = 1 for a flat plane.

>> ○ **Flattening of the Earth:** In terms of equatorial radius a and polar radius b.

> ⑥ Utilization of Geoid **:** Used for establishing the reference surface for trigonometric measurements, determining Earth's radius, surface area, volume, flattening, and standard gravity.

 ⑶ Geoid

> ① Imaginary mean sea level.

> ② Surface perpendicular to the direction of gravity.

> ③ Surface where the potential energy is constant at zero.

> ④ Reference surface for altitude, i.e., altitude of 0 meters above sea level.

> ⑤ Varies based on the density distribution underground.

>> ○ Areas with higher density like metallic ores radiate from that region.

>> ○ Areas with lower density like salt formations and petroleum converge towards those regions.

> ⑥ Utilization of Geoid **:** Used for establishing the reference surface for leveling measurements and measuring altitudes.

 ⑷ Comparison between Geoid and Ellipsoid

> ① Ellipsoid **:** Reference for trigonometric measurements, geometric surface, no curvature.

> ② Geoid **:** Reference for leveling measurements, physical surface, curvature present.

## **2. Size of the Earth**

 ⑴ Initial Attempt **:** Eratosthenes

> ① **Assumption 1:** Earth is a perfect sphere.

> ② **Assumption 2:** Sun's rays are parallel to Earth's surface.

> ③ **Premise 1:** At noon on the solstice, sunlight shines directly into a well in Syene.

> ④ **Premise 2:** At noon on the solstice, the shadow cast by a vertical stick in Alexandria, almost due north, is inclined about 7.2º to the north.

> ⑤ **Premise 3:** Distance between Syene and Alexandria: 925 km.

> ⑥ Measurement of Earth's circumference.

**Figure 1.** Measurement of Earth's circumference 

> ⑦ Sources of error

>> ○ About 15% error.

>> ○ **Cause 1:** Inaccuracies in latitude, longitude, and distance.

>> ○ **Cause 2:** Earth is an oblate spheroid.

 ⑵ Measurement Using Latitude Difference

> ① Extension of Eratosthenes' method.

> ② Proportional relationship

>> ○ 2πR **:** Distance between two points = 360 **:** Difference in latitude between two points.

> ③ Condition **:** Longitudes should be the same.

 ⑶ Measurement Using Polar Altitude Difference

> ① Polar altitude is equal to the latitude of the observation point.

**Figure 2.** Relationship between polar altitude and latitude

> ② Measurement using polar altitude difference is similar to measurement using latitude difference.

## **3.** **Mass and Density of the Earth**

 ⑴ Mass of the Earth

> ① Method using a balance scale by Cavendish

>> ○ The scale is in equilibrium, so the gravitational force acting on each side of the balance is equal.

>> ○ For Earth's radius R⊕, Earth's mass M⊕, and gravitational constant G:

> ② Method using gravitational acceleration **:** Utilizes the equivalence of universal gravitation and gravity.

> ③ Method using artificial satellites **:** Utilizes the equivalence of centrifugal force and universal gravitation.

 ⑵ Density of the Earth

> ① Average density of the Earth

> ② Approximate average density of the crust ≒ 2.7 g/cm³

> ③ Density of materials within the Earth is greater.
