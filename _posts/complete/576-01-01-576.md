## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Stimulus

> ① Definition **:** Changes in the surrounding environment

> ② Characteristics **:** Modality, intensity, location, timing

⑵ Sensation **:** Subjective experience triggered when sensory receptors are activated by a stimulus

> ① Mechanism **:** Sensory transformation → Amplification → Transmission → Integration → Consciousness

>> ○ Sensory receptors **:** Generate action potential when physical stimulus exceeds the threshold

>> ○ Sensory transduction **:** Conversion of light, chemical, mechanical, thermal energy to electrical energy directly or through GPCR mediation

> ② Sensory Encoding **:** Mechanisms to distinguish stimuli

>> ○ Modality of stimulus **:** Labeled-line sensory channel by specific sensory receptors

>>> ○ Law of specific nerve energy **:** Nature of sensation is determined by the type of sensory receptor, not the type of stimulus

>> ○ Intensity of stimulus **:** Magnitude of sensory receptor voltage, frequency of action potential, repetition

>> ○ Location of stimulus **:** Topographical organization

>>> ○ Examples **:** Somatosensory homunculus, Retinotopic map, Tonotopic map

> ③ Types of Sensory Receptors

>> ○ Types of sensory receptors based on stimuli

>>> ○ Electromagnetic receptors

>>> ○ Chemical receptors

>>> ○ Mechanical receptors

>>> ○ Nociceptors

>>> ○ Thermoreceptors

>> ○ Types of sensory receptors based on structure

>>> ○ Simple receptors **:** Neurons with free nerve endings

>>> ○ Complex neural receptors **:** Nerve endings encased in connective tissue sheath

>>> ○ Specialized sensory receptors **:** Release neurotransmitters to initiate action potentials in sensory neurons

>> ○ Types of sensory receptors based on principles

>>> ○ Tonic receptors **:** Slowly adapting receptors

>>>> ○ Maintain depolarization even during sustained stimulus

>>>> ○ Convey stimulus **magnitude** (e.g., proprioceptors, nocioceptors)

>>> ○ Phasic receptors **:** Rapidly adapting receptors

>>>> ○ Cease firing if stimulus intensity remains constant (e.g., olfactory receptors, touch receptors)

>>>> ○ Detect onset, offset, and **changes** of stimulus primarily

> ④ When Neurons are Sensory Cells

>> ○ Olfactory receptors

>> ○ Cutaneous receptors

>> ○ Pacinian receptors

>> ○ Thermoreceptors

>> ○ Renal receptors (e.g., Proximal feedback in cerebellum, unconscious sensation)

⑵ Characteristics of the Sensory System

> ① **Decussation** (chiasm): Sensory and motor tracts in the brain cross over, governing opposite side (contralateral) regions of the body

>> ○ Reasons remain unclear

> ② Synaptic Integration: Sensory information interaction due to connection structure

>> ○ Convergence

>> ○ Divergence

>> ○ Facilitation

>> ○ Occlusion

> ③ Lateral Inhibition: Sensory receptor excitation inhibits nearby receptor activity

>> ○ Two-point discrimination: Ability to distinguish two adjacent stimuli

>>> ○ Example **:** Recognizing spikes in food

>>>> **Figure. 1.** Effect of lateral inhibition on two-point discrimination [Note: 1]

> ④ Adaptation: Gradual decrease in sensory receptor voltage due to sustained stimulus

>> ○ SA (slowly adapting receptor)

>> ○ RA (rapidly adapting receptor)

>> ○ TA (transiently adapting receptor)

> ⑤ Parallel Processing

> ⑥ Descending Control: Sensory information feedback regulation downwards as well

>> ○ Example: Temporarily forgetting touch through other senses

> **Figure. 2.** Example of descending control [Note: 2]

> ⑦ Except for olfactory information, all sensory information passes through the visual cortex

> ⑧ Plasticity

>> ○ Advantage: Increased efficiency in brain's information processing

>> ○ Disadvantage: May lead to conditions like hallucinogenic pain

⑷ Psychophysics

> ① Principles: Physical reality ≠ Psychological reality, active, evolutionary

> ② Psychophysical Measurement Functions

>> ○ Different reactions from different individuals

>> ○ Measuring reactions when stimulus is suddenly introduced in absence of prior stimuli

>> ○ Concepts **:** Detection rate, theoretical threshold curve, threshold-below stimulus, absolute threshold, obtained threshold curve

> ③ Just Noticeable Difference (JND)

>> ○ Weber's Law: ΔI/Ii = constant

>>> ○ Light: ΔIlight / Ii, light × 100 = 8 (%)

>>> ○ Weight: ΔIweight / Ii, weight = 2 (%)

>>> ○ Sound: ΔIsound / Ii, sound = 0.3 (%)

**Figure. 4.** Intensity-response curve of stimuli [Note: 4]

> ④ Signal Detection Theory (SDT)

>> ○ Detecting faint signals in noise

>> ○ Assumption: No single absolute threshold

>> ○ Concepts: Liberal criterion, conservative criterion, noise, signal

> ⑤ Psychophysical Adaptation

⑸ McGurk Effect

> ① Definition: Integrating different sensory information to perceive when perceiving sensory information

> ② Example: Seeing 'ga' but hearing 'ba' results in perception as 'da'
