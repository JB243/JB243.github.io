**Figure 2.** Overview of Wheatstone Bridge

> Let's assume that a resistance R is connected between terminals A and B.

> Let V be the voltage of the battery, VA be the voltage at node A, and VB be the voltage at node B.

> Then, we can obtain the following KCL equation.

> Solving the above equations, we get the following results. (Where 1/R is defined as G.)

> If terminals A-B are open (G = 0), the voltages at each node are as follows.

> This is consistent with the expected voltage division across each series circuit (R1-R3 loop, R2-R4 loop).

> In this case, the currents are as follows.

> If terminals A-B are shorted (G = ∞), the voltages at each node are as follows.

> This is the voltage exactly as expected in a series circuit of two parallel circuits.

> Since the method to calculate currents in each case is the same, we will omit it.

> When R takes an arbitrary value, the current flowing from node A to node B is as follows.

> Note that the denominator is always positive.

> Let's assume an ammeter with an internal resistance R is connected between terminals A-B.

> Let's say if the absolute value of current I exceeds a certain value, the ammeter needle points to full scale.

> Therefore, the condition where the ammeter needle does not move (balanced Wheatstone bridge) is as follows.

> This conclusion also holds for AC bridge circuits.

## **3\. Applications of Wheatstone Bridge Circuit**

 ⑴ Smoke Detector

**Figure 6.** Smoke Detector

> A smoke detector is a sensor that detects fires to activate sprinklers.

> Every public building should have one on every room ceiling!

> Examining the detailed structure of this device, we find the following.

**Figure 7.** Detailed Structure of Smoke Detector

> Two variable resistors that change their resistance value according to the light intensity are built-in.

> The light from the light source is applied to the variable resistors through two mirrors (reflectors).

> (In other words, the light from the light source spreads radiantly, but only the light incident at a specific angle can reach each resistor.)

> If a fire occurs and smoke is generated, the amount of light reflected on the bottom mirror decreases.

> This is because the light is scattered by smoke particles.

> Thus, the difference in resistance values between the reference cell and the smoke detector increases significantly, triggering a fire alarm.

> The circuit representation of this setup is as follows.

**Figure 8.** Detailed Circuit Diagram of Wheatstone Bridge

> Let's assume the voltage of the DC power supply is V.

> If we let Rbalance = R, then Vbalance is as follows.

> Let's now consider the following facts.

>> a. Photoconductive cells have a linearly changing resistance with light intensity.

>> b. RReference = R

> As a result, the output voltage Vbalance is proportional to the change in resistance value.

> The reason for setting Rbalance as a variable resistor is to compensate for manufacturing errors.

 ⑵ Silicon Pressure Sensor

> The pressure sensor utilizes the piezoresistive effect where resistance value changes due to external force.

> The shape of the pressure sensor is shown below.

**Figure 9.** Shape of Pressure Sensor

> For convenience, let's name the resistances in a clockwise direction from the 9 o'clock position as R1, R2, R3, R4.

> The right diagram is a top view of the left diagram.

> In the right diagram, the length of the thick part is about 0.5 mm, and the vertical length of the thin diaphragm is about 1-2 nm.

> The horizontal length of the thin diaphragm is in millimeters.

> Silicon is used for the pressure sensor because it etches easily in KOH due to its good crystal structure.

> The vertical stress (longitudinal stress) of R1 and R3 is the same as the trans

verse stress of R2 and R4.

> The transverse stress of R1 and R3 is the same as the longitudinal stress of R2 and R4.

**Figure 10.** Material and Stress Representation

> If one resistance receives a vertical stress of σl, it also receives a transverse stress of σt = -νσl.

> Here, ν is the Poisson's ratio.

**Figure 11.** Tensile Stress and Poisson's Ratio of Material[Note:9]

> Note that strain (ε) is a strain ratio, calculated by dividing the change in length (δ) by the initial length.

**Figure 12.** Meaning of Strain

**Figure 13.** Strain-Stress Curve

> The resistance value of the strain gauge has properties similar to length.

> In other words, just like strain is proportional to stress (σ = Eε, E **:** Young's modulus), ΔR / R is also proportional to stress.

> Similarly, the transverse stress and longitudinal stress of R1 and R3 independently affect ΔR / R.

> Therefore, we can express the changes in R1 and R3 due to external stress as follows.

> Similarly, we can express the changes in R2 and R4 due to external stress as follows.

> One product has the values of the following constants.

> Thus,

> (Note **:** There may be errors in calculations.)

> As a result, we can express this as follows.

> Let's represent this sensor in a circuit.

**Figure 14.** Wheatstone Bridge Circuit for the Given Scenario

> In this case, due to the small values of α1 and α2 (0.02 or smaller), and the fact that there is at most a 10% difference,

> Since external pressure and stress are proportional, this sensor outputs a value proportional to pressure.

 ⑶ Strain Gauge Bridge

> A transducer that measures Strain induced by force is designed as follows.

**Figure 15.** Structure of Strain Gauge Bridge[Note:12]

> Blue or yellow boxes represent piezoelectric elements (proportional to stress) where resistance values change according to Strain.

> When force is applied vertically and horizontally, the device deforms as follows.

**Figure 16.** Operating Principle of Strain Gauge Bridge

> The area where the blue box is placed becomes concave, exerting compressive force on the resistance marked by the blue box.

> Similarly, the area where the yellow box is lifted becomes convex, exerting tensile force on the resistance marked by the yellow box.

> As a result, the resistance value of the blue-boxed resistance decreases, and the resistance value of the yellow-boxed resistance increases.

> Let's represent this setup in a circuit.

**Figure 17.** Wheatstone Bridge Circuit for the Given Problem Scenario[Note:13]

> This circuit has already been discussed extensively, so let's consider the following circuit.

**Figure 18.** Application of Wheatstone Bridge Circuit[Note:14]

> By examining the bridge circuit, we can find vi.

> Therefore, due to the dependent voltage source, the voltage between the wire ends with the 50 Ω resistor and the voltmeter is ΔR / R × 50b mV.

> However, since the internal resistance of the DMM is around 10-11 MΩ, an approximation can be made as follows.

> As a result, a circuit that amplifies the value due to external Stress has been completed.

 ⑷ Murray's Loop Method

> One of the methods for electrical fault detection, using the principles of Wheatstone Bridge to detect faults (1-wire short circuit) on a circuit.

> This method requires a healthy auxiliary wire 1-wire.

**Figure 19.** Murray's Loop Method Diagram[Note:15]

> If no current flows in the ammeter, it is in equilibrium state.

> However, L **:** Total length of the line (m), x **:** Distance from measurement point to fault point (m)

> The Murray's Loop Method is a measurement method for 1-wire short circuit and short circuit between wires.

> The measurement method for 3-wire short circuit and short circuit between wires is the pulse measurement method (pulse radar).

> The measurement method for single-wire fault is the capacitive bridge method.
