## **1\. Bias Circuits**

 ⑴ Issue **:** Input signal of the amplification circuit is AC and small in magnitude.

 ⑵ Apply appropriate DC voltage to the transistor to perform its intended function.

> ① Generally, design the function in the active region for BJT transistors.

> ② Generally, design the function in the saturation region for FET transistors.

 ⑶ Bias circuits for BJT transistors

> ① Base bias circuit

>> ○ Circuit that adjusts VC and VB with a single power source and 2 resistors.

>> ○ Not commonly used due to low temperature stability.

> ② Emitter bias circuit

>> ○ Adjust VC and VB with 2 voltage sources.

>> ○ Disadvantage of needing two voltage sources.

## **2\. Large-Signal, Small-Signal Analysis**

 ⑴ General circuit design

> ① DC voltage is necessary for bias.

> ② Use capacitors to block distortion in the output signal caused by DC voltage: blocking effect for DC.

> ③ Use capacitors with sufficient capacitance to allow AC signals to pass easily: bypass effect for AC.

 ⑵ Signal analysis

> ① Small-signal analysis **:** Interpreting the circuit using the superposition principle by separating DC and AC power supplies.

>> ○ Generally, uppercase for DC quantities, lowercase for AC quantities.

> ② Large-signal analysis **:** Interpreting the circuit in the time domain by considering both DC and AC power supplies.

> ③ Large-signal analysis is mathematically complex, so small-signal analysis is preferred.
