 **Figure. 1.** Habitable Zone

> ② Drake Equation **:** Equation for the number of communicative extraterrestrial civilizations

## **2\. Star Clusters**

 ⑴ Definition **:** A group of stars that are densely packed within a region of space

 ⑵ **Classification 1.** Open Clusters

> ① Definition **:** Star clusters where stars are young and dispersed

> ② Number of Stars **:** Tens to thousands ( **∵** Stars are young)

> ③ Color **:** Blue ( **∵** High temperature due to youth)

> ④ Distribution Area **:** Spiral Arms ( **∵** Recently captured by the galaxy)

> ⑤ Main Feature **:** Main sequence stars are prominent on the H-R diagram

 ⑶ **Classification 2.** Globular Clusters

> ① Definition **:** Star clusters where stars are old and arranged in a spherical shape

> ② Number of Stars **:** Hundreds of thousands to millions ( **∵** Stars are old)

> ③ Color **:** Red ( **∵** Low temperature due to age)

> ④ Distribution Area **:** Halo, Central Bulge ( **∵** Central movement over time)

> ⑤ Main Feature **:** Red giant branch and horizontal branch exist on the H-R diagram

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Nebulae**

 ⑴ Definition **:** Celestial bodies that have a cloud-like appearance

 ⑵ Interstellar Dust

> ① Interstellar Dimming **:** Dimming of light due to interstellar dust, leading to higher apparent magnitude

> ② Interstellar Reddening **:** Red light scatters less, making it easier to observe

>> ○ Excess Color = Observed (B - V) - Intrinsic (B - V)

> ③ Interstellar Blueing **:** When interstellar matter scatters starlight, it is mainly observed as blue

 ⑶ Interstellar Gas

> ① **Region 1.** Molecular Clouds **:** Hydrogen molecules. Lower temperature, higher density. Birthplace of stars

> ② **Region 2.** HⅠ Region **:** Neutral hydrogen. Emits 21 cm radio waves → Discovery of spiral arms in our galaxy

> ③ **Region 3.** HⅡ Region **:** Ionized hydrogen. Higher temperature, lower density

 ⑷ Types of Nebulae

> ① Dark Nebulae (e.g., Horsehead Nebula)

> ② Reflection Nebulae (e.g., Pleiades Nebula)

>> ○ Interstellar dimming, interstellar reddening, interstellar blueing occur

> ③ Emission Nebulae (or Extragalactic Nebulae) (e.g., Orion Nebula)

>> ○ O and B-type stars present within emission nebulae

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Emission of ultraviolet radiation by stars

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Surrounding hydrogen ionization

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Ionized hydrogen combines with surrounding electrons, returning to neutral state

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Emission of red visible light

 ⑸ Extragalactic Nebulae beyond Galaxy **:** Observed by the Hubble Law

## **4. Galaxies**

 ⑴ Types of Galaxies

> ① Normal Spiral Galaxy

> ② Barred Spiral Galaxy

>> ○ Contains a bar-shaped structure crossing the nucleus

> ③ Elliptical Galaxy

>> ○ Low interstellar matter. Classified from E0 to E7 based on flattening

>> ○ Higher proportion of older stars, like in globular clusters

> ④ Irregular Galaxy

>> ○ Higher proportion of younger stars, like in open clusters

 ⑵ **Example 1.** Milky Way

**Figure. 2.** Profile of the Galaxy 1

> ① Diameter **:** 98,000 light-years

> ② Shape **:** Barred spiral galaxy

> ③ Central Region **:** Primarily open clusters

> ④ Outer Region **:** Primarily globular clusters

> ⑤ Halo **:** A spherical region surrounding the galactic disk

>> ○ Mass of the halo is comparable to the total mass of luminous objects in the galaxy

> ⑥ Research that Revealed the Milky Way's Spiral Structure

>> ○ Energy **:** Proton and electron spinning in the same direction (gyration) > Proton and electron spinning in opposite directions

>> ○ Difference in energy levels corresponds to the energy of 21 cm hydrogen line

>> ○ Due to the rotation of the Milky Way, the Doppler effect causes the 21 cm hydrogen line emitted by neutral hydrogen

>> ○ Line-of-sight velocity maps intensity → Amount of hydrogen, hydrogen's location → Proves the existence of spiral arms

 ⑶ **Example 2.** Andromeda Galaxy

> ① Among 20 galaxies around the Milky Way, only the Andromeda Galaxy is larger

> ② Initially classified as a star, later identified as a galaxy due to advances in observation technology

 ⑷ Quasars

> ① Enormous galaxies appearing like stars due to their extreme distance

> ② Shows a similar apparent magnitude as

 stars in the Milky Way

> ③ Exhibits strong redshift, indicating it's a very distant extragalactic object
