## **1\. Laboratory Reactions and Biological Reactions**

⑴ **Difference 1.** Number of Reactions

> ① Laboratory Reactions: 100 ~ several hundred

>> ○ So far, mankind has developed fewer than 400 basic substances.

> ② Biological Reactions

>> ○ An individual organism depends on about [200 to 300](https://www.cheme.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/matthew-delisa#:~:text=life%20depends%20on%20200-300%20core%20biological%20processes) significant biological processes

>> ○ Each biological process consists of dozens of sub-reactions

>> ○ Therefore, there are thousands of chemical reactions operating within a single organism

>> ○ Due to variations in types of chemical reactions between species, the total number of biological reactions is much greater

>> ○ Example: [Glucose Catabolism](https://jb243.github.io/pages/70#footnote_link_67_52)

>>> ○ Consists of 10 steps

>>> ○ Involves 2 types of shuttle molecules

>>> ○ Pyruvate oxidation reaction

>>> ○ TCA cycle involving 8 enzymes

>>> ○ Electron transport chain involving 4 complexes

>>> ○ 2 electron carriers (NADH, FADH<sub>2</sub>)

 ⑵ **Difference 2.** Stability of Reactions (Homeostasis)

> ① Laboratory Reactions: Mostly describe well-defined reactions under controlled environment and reactant conditions

> ② Biological Reactions: Exhibit significant stability even in irregular external environments
