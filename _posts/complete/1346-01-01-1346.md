## **1.** **Oxidation Number** 

 ⑴ Definition: The hypothetical charge that an element would have if it lost all of its shared electron pairs, assuming the element with the higher electronegativity had taken them.

 ⑵ Oxidation number of each atom = charge of the atom + valence electrons of the atom - number of bonds - number of unshared electrons

> ① Fractional oxidation numbers represent average oxidation states

 ⑶ In nature, the oxidation numbers of atoms are standardized: Priority is given to the order ① ＞ ··· ＞ ⑦

> ① The sum of oxidation numbers of atoms composing a neutral compound is 0.

> ② The sum of oxidation numbers of atoms composing an ion is equal to the charge of the ion.

> ③ The oxidation number of fluorine is always -1.

> ④ Alkali metals are +1, alkaline earth metals are +2, aluminum is +3.

> ⑤ Hydrogen is +1.

>> ○ Exception: In LiH, the oxidation number of H is -1.

> ⑥ Oxygen is -2.

>> ○ Exception 1. In OF2, the oxidation number of O is +2.

>> ○ Exception 2. H2O2 (-1), O2- (-1/2), O3- (-1/3).

> ⑦ Halogen elements excluding fluorine are -1.

>> ○ Exception: When combined with oxygen (e.g., OCl2), it is +1.

## **2. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions**

 ⑴ Oxidation: The loss of high-energy electrons by atoms, molecules, ions, etc.

> ① Expression 1. An increase in oxidation number

> ② Expression 2. Gaining oxygen

>> ○ Before reaction: The oxidation number of each O atom in O2 is 0.

>> ○ After reaction: The oxidation number of O in molecules becomes -2, and other species experience an increase in oxidation number.

> ③ Expression 3. Losing hydrogen

>> ○ Before reaction: Generally, the oxidation number of H in a molecule is +1.

>> ○ After reaction: H2 with oxidation numbers of 0 for each atom is produced, causing other species to experience an increase in oxidation number.

> ④ Expression 4. A reaction that loses energy: Due to the loss of high-energy electrons.

 ⑵ Reduction: The gain of high-energy electrons by atoms, molecules, ions, etc.

> ① Expression 1. A decrease in oxidation number

> ② Expression 2. Losing oxygen

>> ○ Before reaction: Generally, the oxidation number of O in a molecule is -2.

>> ○ After reaction: O2 with oxidation numbers of 0 for each atom is produced, causing other species to experience a decrease in oxidation number.

> ③ Expression 3. Gaining hydrogen

>> ○ Before reaction: The oxidation number of each H atom in H2 is 0.

>> ○ After reaction: The oxidation number of H in molecules becomes +1, and other species experience a decrease in oxidation number.

> ④ Expression 4. A reaction that gains energy: Due to the gain of high-energy electrons.

 ⑶ Simultaneity: Oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously, and the change in oxidation number is equal to the number of transferred electrons.

 ⑷ Oxidation-reduction reactions involve the direct movement of electrons, unlike acid-base reactions.

## **3. Oxidizing Agents and Reducing Agents**

 ⑴ Definition

> ① Oxidizing agent: A substance that is reduced itself while oxidizing another substance.

> ② Reducing agent: A substance that is oxidized itself while reducing another substance.

 ⑵ Relative Strength of Oxidizing Agents

> ① The stronger the tendency to gain electrons (Group 17), the stronger the oxidizing agent.

> ② Compounds containing metals or nonmetals with high oxidation numbers

>> ○ Example: In K2Cr2O7, the oxidation number of Cr is +6, making it a strong oxidizing agent.

> ③ If an element can have multiple oxidation numbers, the greater the oxidation number, the stronger the oxidizing agent.

>> ○ KMnO4 > MnO2 > Mn2O3 > MnCl2

>> ○ KMnO4: Since the oxidation number of Mn is +7, it oxidizes other substances to achieve a lower oxidation state.

> ④ If the oxidation state is lower than usual, the substance can function as an oxidizing agent.

>> ○ Hydrogen peroxide: The oxidation number of O in H2O2 is -1, so it oxidizes other substances to achieve -2.

 ⑶ Relative Strength of Reducing Agents

> ① The stronger the tendency to lose electrons (lower left of the periodic table), the stronger the reducing agent.

> ② Compounds containing metals or nonmetals with low oxidation numbers

> ③ If an element can have multiple oxidation numbers, the lower the oxidation number, the stronger the reducing agent.

>> ○ Example: H2S (-2) > S (0) > SO2 (+4) > SO3 (+6)

 ⑷ Relative Nature of Oxidizing Agents and Reducing Agents: Depending on the reaction, substances can act as either oxidizing agents or reducing agents.

> ① **Example 1:** Disproportionation reaction: A → A' + A", where A' and A" have different oxidation states.

>> ○ 4SO2 + 3H2O → S2O32- + 2HSO4- + 4H+

## **4. Balancing Chemical Equations**

 ⑴ **Oxidation Number Method**

> ① Definition: Utilizing the fact that the increase in oxidation number is equal to the decrease in oxidation number.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Write the skeletal equation

MnO4-(aq) + H2C2O4(aq) → Mn2+(aq) + CO2(g)

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Calculate the change in oxidation number (x) for the oxidation skeletal equation

>> Oxidation number of carbon indicated by [ **·** ]: H2C2O4(aq) [+6] → 2CO2(g) [+8]

>> x = +2

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Calculate the change in oxidation number (y) for the reduction skeletal equation

>> Oxidation number of manganese indicated by [ **·** ]: MnO4-(aq) [+7] → Mn2+(aq) [+2]

>> y = -5

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Multiply the oxidation and reduction skeletal equations by appropriate factors to make the change in oxidation number for both equations equal to the least common multiple of x and y (10), then add them together

>> 2MnO4-(aq) + 5H2C2O4(aq) → 2Mn2+(aq) + 10CO2(g)

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. In an acidic environment, balance the number of O atoms with H2O and the number of H atoms with H+

>>> 2MnO4-(aq) + 5H2C2O4(aq) → 2Mn2+(aq) + 10CO2(g) + 8H2O(ℓ)

>>> 2MnO4-(aq) + 5H2C2O4(aq) + 6H+(aq) → 2Mn2+(aq) + 10CO2(g) + 8H2O(ℓ)

>>> 2MnO4-(aq) + 5H2C2O4(aq) + 6H2O(ℓ) - 6OH-(aq) → 2Mn2+(aq) + 10CO2(g) + 8H2O(ℓ)

>>> 2MnO4-(aq) + 5H2C2O4(aq) → 2Mn2+(aq) + 10CO2(g) + 2H2O(ℓ) + 6OH-(aq)

>> ○ 6<sup>th</sup> - 2<sup>nd</sup>. Review: Check if charge balance is maintained

 ⑵ Ion-Electron Method: Obtain the oxidation half-equation and the reduction half-equation, then add the two half-equations together.
