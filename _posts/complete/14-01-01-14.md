## **1. Series-Parallel Composition**(series-parallel simplification)

 ⑴ Series-Parallel Composition of Power Sources

> ① The composite voltage due to series connection of voltage sources is equal to the sum of the voltages of each voltage source.

> ② Parallel connection of voltage sources producing different voltages can lead to explosions.

> ③ Composite voltage of parallel connection of voltage sources producing the same voltage v is v (increases lifespan).

> ④ Series connection of current sources producing different currents can lead to explosions.

> ⑤ Composite current of series connection of current sources producing the same current i is i (increases lifespan).

> ⑥ The composite current due to parallel connection of current sources is equal to the sum of the currents of each current source.

 ⑵ Series-Parallel Composition of Load **:** Several components can be treated as one component

## **2. Kirchhoff's Laws**

 ⑴ Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL, Kirchhoff current law) **:** Conservation of charge. Node analysis.

**Figure. 4.** Kirchhoff's Current Law

> ① Kirchhoff's law applies regardless of linearity/non-linearity, lumped/distributed parameters, and time-varying/time-invariant systems.

> ② Whether current is flowing out or in, it must be unified **:** Negative values are also considered.

>> ○ Electromagnetic perspective **:** Outgoing current from the system is considered positive, similar to heat physics. The sum of outgoing currents from any node is zero.

>> ○ Electrical engineering perspective **:** Incoming current to the system is considered positive, similar to heat chemistry. The sum of incoming currents to any node is zero.

> ③ Also known as **node voltage analysis** **:** Node voltages are defined, and KCL is applied.

> ④ Super-node **:** Composed of two or more nodes connected to a power source. Reduces the number of unknowns.

**Figure. 5.** Super-node

> ⑤ **Tip:** Node voltage analysis is recommended over mesh current analysis.

> ⑥ **Example 1:**

**Figure. 6.** Example 1

> ⑦ **Example 2:**

**Figure. 7.** Example 2

 ⑵ Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL, Kirchhoff voltage law) **:** Mesh or loop analysis.

> ① Types of paths

>> ○ Mesh **:** The most basic circuit

>> ○ Loop **:** A circuit with no open branches. Closed curve, also known as a closed loop.

>> ○ Examples

**Figure. 8.** Types of paths [Footnote: 2]

>>> ○ ⒜ **:** This is not a path. KVL does not hold.

>>> ○ ⒝ **:** This is not a path. It passes the same node twice.

>>> ○ ⒞ **:** This is not a mesh since it encloses another loop.

>>> ○ ⒟ **:** Similar to ⒞, this is not a mesh due to the same reason.

>>> ○ ⒠, ⒡ **:** These are loops and also meshes.

>>> ○ Mesh determination is not essential **:** But using mesh helps in creating a system of linear equations strategically.

> ② The sum of voltage drops around any closed path is zero.

**Figure. 9.** Kirchhoff's Voltage Law

> ③ Also known as **mesh current analysis** **:** Mesh currents are defined, and KVL is applied.

>> ○ Mesh currents are assigned to each mesh.

>> ○ Current flowing through each component is expressed as the sum or difference of mesh currents.

>> ○ Apply KVL around each mesh.

>> ○ **Tip:** You can also use variables for unknown points without specifying mesh currents.

> ④ **Proof 1:**

>> ○ Fundamentally, the electric field E is a conservative field. Any closed path X(t), a ≤ t ≤ b can be parameterized (where X(a) = X(b)).

>> ○ Mathematical development **:** For grad V = **E**

>> ○ (Note) This proof is also used when deriving the law of conservation of energy for conservative fields.

>> ○ (Note) Dot product of **E** and d **l** signifies voltage drop.

>> ○ (Note) Combining the law of conservation of energy and voltage drop analysis: Work done on a unit charge is equal to the decrease in potential.

> ⑤ **Proof 2:**

>> ○ Maxwell's Third Law **:** Faraday's Law. Change in an external magnetic field induces an electric field.

>> ○ When there is no change in the external magnetic field, curl E vector = **0** **:** Using Green's theorem.

> ⑥ Limitation **:** Some problems can only be solved with KCL (e.g., [Op Amp](https://jb243.github.io/pages/5)).

> ⑦ **Example 1:**

**Figure. 10.** Example 1

 ⑶ All circuits can be solved using KCL and KVL.

> ① Therefore, the voltage and current at any point can be determined.

> ② (Note) Existence of equivalent circuits can be proven through induction.

## **3. Superposition Principle**

 ⑴ Definition **:** The sum of effects caused by each independent power source in a circuit with multiple independent power sources is equal to the actual effect.

> ① Linear Components **:** Components where the superposition principle can be applied, such as resistors (R), capacitors (C), inductors (L), linear power sources, etc.

> ② Superposition principle holds due to linearity of electric fields.

> ③ Power is not considered.

> ④ Superposition principle can also be applied in small-signal analysis.

 ⑵ Superposition Principle for Average Power **:** For periodic power sources

> ① AC power indicates average power.

**Figure. 11.** Superposition Principle for Average Power

> ② Superposition principle for average power is not applicable in most cases.

> ③ Applicable when composed of AC power sources with different frequencies.

 ⑸ **Lemma 1:** All circuits can be equivalenced (existence)

> ① Not all circuits can be equivalenced.

>> ○ The load part can have any component.

> ② **Case 1:** Circuits entirely composed of resistors and power sources where equivalence is applicable

>> ○ Strategy **:** Start with the closest component to a specific component in the circuit and draw Thevenin equivalent circuits.

>> ○ When encountering a resistor in between **:** Use Thevenin - Norton reciprocity (source transformation).

>> ○ When encountering a voltage source in between **:** Introduce a change to vth in vtest = itestRth + vth.

>> ○ When encountering a current source in between **:** Convert to a Norton equivalent circuit and apply KCL.

>> ○ In a circuit with only independent power sources, Rth can never be negative.

> ③ **Case 2:** All power sources in the circuit have the same frequency: R, L, C can be considered as resistors.

 ⑹ **Lemma 2:** Every circuit has a unique Thevenin equivalent circuit (uniqueness)

> ① Assume a circuit has Thevenin equivalent circuits A and B.

> ② In this case, the open-circuit voltage at two terminals in the circuit must be the same ⇒ Vth of A and B are the same.

> ③ The short-circuit current at two terminals in the circuit must be the same ⇒ Vth ÷ ith = Rth of A and B are the same.

> ④ Conclusion **:** A and B are identical.

 ⑺ **Lemma 3:** Power consumption of any circuit and its equivalent circuit may be different

**Figure. 26.** Example showing that power consumption of equivalent circuits is not always the same [Footnote: 4]

> ① In case ⒜ **:** Power consumption in resistance within N is 10 W.

> ② In case ⒝ **:** Power consumption in resistance within Nth is 1 W.

> ③ Since ⒜ and ⒝ have the same loading effect for both terminals, the load power is **always the same.**
