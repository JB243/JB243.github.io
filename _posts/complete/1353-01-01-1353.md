## **1\. Solubility**

 ⑴ Solubility of Solids **:** Solubility increases as temperature increases

> ① ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

> ② | ΔH lattice | ≒ | ΔH hydration | ⇒ ΔH solution ≃ 0

> ③ Dissolution of solids is a reaction with ΔS ＞ 0

> ④ T↑ ⇒ ΔG↓

 ⑵ Solubility of Liquids **:** Solubility increases as temperature increases

> ① ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

> ② | ΔH lattice | ≒ | ΔH hydration | ⇒ ΔH solution ≃ 0

> ③ Dissolution of liquids is a reaction with ΔS ＞ 0

> ④ T↑ ⇒ ΔG↓

 ⑶ Solubility of Gases **:** Solubility decreases as temperature increases

> ① ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

> ② | ΔH lattice | ≒ | ΔH hydration | ⇒ ΔH solution ≃ 0

> ③ Dissolution of gases is a reaction with ΔS ＜ 0

> ④ T↑ ⇒ ΔG↑

 ⑷ Limiting Enthalpy of Solution

> ① Definition **:** Enthalpy of formation of a dilute solution where solute-solute interactions can be neglected

## **2\. Solubility Product Constant**

 ⑴ Solubility Product Constant

> ① Definition **:** Taking AgCl as an example.

>> ○ Definition of Precipitation **:** When [Ag+] × [Cl-] < Ksp, the degree of freedom of AgCl( _s_ ) is not 1, so it is defined as not precipitating.

>> ○ Precipitation reaction is a specific form of acid-base reaction.

> ② Relationship with Solubility s (g/L)

> ③ Solubility Product Constant Ksp at 25 ℃

**Table. 1.** Solubility Product Constants at 25 ℃

> ④ Major Precipitates

>> ○ Calcium Carbonate (CaCl2) **:** White precipitate

>> ○ Barium Sulfate (BaSO4) **:** White precipitate

>> ○ Lead Iodide (PbI2) **:** Yellow precipitate

>> ○ Silver Chloride (AgCl) **:** White precipitate

>> ○ Silver Iodide (AgI) **:** Yellow precipitate

>> ○ Manganese Dioxide (MnO2) **:** Brown precipitate

>> ○ Fe(OH)2 **:** Green rust

>> ○ Fe(OH)3 **:** Dark orange

 ⑵ Precipitation **:** The phenomenon of forming solid products and settling due to excessive presence of ions.

> ① Precipitation **:** Comparing Reaction Quotient Q with Ksp

>> ○ Q > K **:** Precipitation occurs ↔ Excess ions present

>> ○ Q < K **:** No precipitation reaction occurs ↔ Insufficient ions present

> ② Common Ion Effect **:** Decrease in solubility in the presence of a common ion.

> ③ Salt Effect

 ⑶ Common Ion Effect

 ⑷ pH and Solubility

> ① Hydroxides

> ② Basic Salts
