## **1\. Characteristics of Sound**

 ⑴ **Characteristic 1.** Intensity or Amplitude **:** Loudness of sound

> ① Weber-Fechner law **:** Presents a scale for the intensity (sound pressure) of sound

> ② dB SPL (decibels sound pressure level)

>> ○ Definition **:** Represents the magnitude of relative sound pressure on a logarithmic scale

>> ○ dB SPL = 0.1 B SPL = 10 × log10(I / I0) = 20 × log10(P / Pref)

>> ○ Pref = 0 dB SPL = 0.0002 dyne/cm2 = 20 μPa

> ③ dB HL (decibels hearing level)

>> ○ Definition **:** Represents the sound intensity based on the average threshold of audibility (0 dB HL) for normal young adults (18-30 years old, male and female)

>> ○ dB HL = 20 × log10(P1 / P2)

>> ○ 0 dB HL ≒ 7 dB SPL (at 1 kHz)

>> ○ Audiometric Zero = 0 dB HL at each frequency

> ④ dB SL (decibels sensation level)

>> ○ Definition **:** Represents sound intensity greater than an individual's threshold

>> ○ Stimulus intensity - Threshold = sensation level

>> ○ Example **:** A patient with a 30 dB loss perceives 50 dB SPL as 20 dB SL

 ⑵ **Characteristic 2.** Frequency (Pitch) **:** Highness or lowness of sound

> ① [Pythagorean Scale](https://jb243.github.io/pages/740)

> ② Audible Frequency **:** 16 ~ 20,000 Hz

> ③ Conversational Frequency **:** 250 ~ 2,000 Hz

> ④ Below 1,000 Hz **:** Distinguishable approximately every 1 Hz

> ⑤ Above 1,000 Hz **:** Distinguishable at more than 0.1% intervals of the reference frequency

> ⑥ Head Shadow Effect (Baffle Effect)

>> ○ Definition **:** Phenomenon where higher-frequency sounds lose more energy than lower-frequency sounds as they pass over the head

>> ○ The ear opposite to the sound source perceives lower sound

>> ○ Brain integrates information from both ears to process frequency information

 ⑶ **Characteristic 3.** Phase **:** Temporal relationship between two simultaneous sounds

 ⑷ **Characteristic 4.** Spectrum, Tone, or Timbre

> ① Pure Tone **:** Tone represented by a single sine function

> ② Complex Tone **:** Tone represented by two or more sine functions

>> ○ Musical Tone **:** Periodic, pleasant

>> ○ Noise **:** Irregular, unpleasant

## **2\. Speed of Sound**

 ⑴ Formula **:** For density ρ (kg/m3) and bulk modulus B (N/m2)

 ⑵ Derivation

> If the pressure acting on fluid element ρAΔx is P0 \+ p1 on the left and P0 \+ p2 on the right, the net force is

> The equation of motion is

> Dividing both sides by Δx and taking the limit,

> Also, from the expression of bulk expansion,

> The change in pressure ΔP has an average value of p1 or p2, which is p. Then

> Substituting this equation into the equation of motion

> Therefore, the speed of sound is as follows.

 ⑶ It can be expressed as follows

 ⑷ Speed of Sound in Liquid

> ① In liquids, isothermal change occurs

> ② Formulation

>> ○ **Tip:** Sound speed decreases with increasing pressure

>> ○ **Tip:** Inference can be easily made through dimensional analysis

> ③ (Note) Nozzles and Sound Speed

>> ○ Purpose of Nozzle **:** Increase flow velocity. i.e., raise kinetic energy

>> ○ Enlarging Nozzle **:** Supersonic possible

>> ○ Constricting Nozzle **:** Subsonic possible

>> ○ Nozzle Throat **:** Sound speed cannot be exceeded

 ⑸ Speed of Sound in Air

> ① In air, adiabatic change occurs

> ② Formulation

>> ○ k **:** Specific heat ratio

>> ○ R **:** 287 J/kg·K

> ③ **Tip:** Density has little effect, only temperature matters

>> ○ Crows listen in the day, mice listen at night

>> ○ Warm ground causes higher sound speed, leading to upward refraction

>> ○ Cold ground causes slower sound speed, leading to downward refraction

 ⑹ Speed of Sound in Space

> ① Space was considered vacuum, thought sound cannot propagate

> ② In 2003, NASA demonstrated that sound can propagate in space

> ③ Thus, pressure waves generated by black holes vibrate interstellar gas, creating and propagating sound

## **3\. Propagating Sound Waves**

 ⑴ Expression of Sound Waves traveling through a Tube

> ① Displacement

> ② Pressure

> ③ When displacement is maximum, pressure change is 0, and when displacement is 0, pressure change is maximum

 ⑵ Relationship between Pressure Amplitude and Displacement Amplitude

## **4\. Applications**

 ⑴ **Application 1.** Bats

> ① Bats use reflected ultrasonic waves from prey to locate their position

> ② Bats use the Doppler effect to determine prey's velocity

 ⑵ **Application 2.** Ultrasonic Testing

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Ultrasonic waves generated by the testing device

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Ultrasonic waves reflected from blood

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Determine blood velocity using the frequency difference of the two ultrasonic waves → Assess patient's health status
