## **1\. Ancient Mechanics** **:** Aristotelian Propositions

 ⑴ Paradox of the Bow and Arrow **:** Nature dislikes a vacuum

 ⑵ Objects need continuous force to be in motion due to their tendency to rest

 ⑶ Heavier objects fall faster

 ⑷ Natural motion

> ① Motion on Earth **:** Straight motion

> ② Motion in the heavens **:** Circular motion

> ③ Introduced for religious significance

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Medieval Mechanics**

 ⑴ John Philoponus (490-570)

> ① Object's speed is proportional to its weight

> ② Speed of an object decreases due to the resistance of the medium

 ⑵ Buridan

> ① An object, once force is applied, will continue to move

> ② With resistance, the force diminishes and the object stops eventually

> ③ Introduced the concept of modern momentum

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Modern Mechanics**

 ⑴ Galileo

> ① Explained inertia, the tendency of objects to maintain their state of motion

> ② Through thought experiments, refuted Aristotle's argument by connecting light and heavy objects

> ③ Conducted experiments on free fall

 ⑵ Huygens

> ① Explained the motion of objects that describe inertia in a straight direction

 ⑶ Newton

> ① Without external forces, an object's acceleration is 0

> ② Defined force as the cause of changes in momentum

 ⑷ Descartes

> ① Proposed the conservation of momentum

 ⑸ Mayer

> ① Proposed the conservation of energy

 ⑹ Joule

> ① Explored heat-work conversion

 ⑺ Thomson

> ① Completed the law of conservation of energy
