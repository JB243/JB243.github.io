## **1. Biological Classification**

  ⑴ Purpose **:** A classification of organisms to reveal their relationships with each other.

  ⑵ Methods

> ① Natural Classification **:** Classifying organisms according to their evolutionary processes or relationships.

> ② Artificial Classification **:** Classifying organisms based on arbitrary criteria.

>> ○ Example **:** Terrestrial animals, aquatic plants, medicinal plants, edible fungi, herbivores, etc.

  ⑶ Phylogenetic Classification Methods

> ① **Method 1:** Structural similarity

>> ○ Mainly used to classify extinct species; based on geological age.

>> ○ Used for subdividing the history of extinct organisms, determining geological epochs.

> ② **Method 2:** Modern phylogenetic classification

>> ○ DNA sequences of closely related organisms are more similar in evolution.

>> ○ Comparison using small subunit rRNA genes (ribosomal RNA), cytochrome c amino acid sequences, etc.

>> ○ These encode important proteins, thus evolutionarily conserved.

> ③ Modern species are divided into domains and their subdomains based on structural similarity and phylogenetic history.

  ⑷ Biological Classification System

> ① Comprehensive Taxonomic Ranks **:** Implying recent shared ancestry within the same rank.

> ② Taxonomic Ranks **:** Domain – Kingdom – Phylum – Class – Order – Family – Genus – Species, total of 8 levels.

>> ○ Domain **:** Bacteria domain, Archaea domain, Eukarya domain

>> ○ Kingdom **:** Eukarya domain subdivided into Protista, Plantae, Fungi, Animalia

>> ○ Current classification system **:** 3 domains, 6 kingdoms

> ③ History of Classification

>> ○ Aristotle **:** Classified 540 animal species.

>> ○ 2-kingdom classification **:** Divided into non-motile plants and motile animals.

>> ○ 3-kingdom classification **:** Classified unicellular organisms as Protista.

>> ○ 4-kingdom classification **:** Divided non-nucleated organisms into Prokaryota.

>> ○ 5-kingdom classification **:** Separated non-photosynthetic bacteria from Plantae.

>> ○ 3-domain, 6-kingdom classification **:** Archaea found to be more similar to Eukarya than Bacteria.

> ④ When finer classification is needed, terms like Domain, Division, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Subspecies are added between each rank.

>> ○ Subspecies **:** Geographically or morphologically distinct group, no reproductive barriers.

>> ○ Variety **:** Group with 2-3 differing traits or distributions due to natural mutations.

>> ○ Cultivar **:** Cultivated group of a species with artificial selection.

  ⑸ Scientific Nomenclature

> ① Necessity **:** For the uniformity of academic research.

>> ○ Latin remains unchanged over time and location.

> ② Binomial Nomenclature **:** Genus and species names combined in Latin.

>> ○ Invented by Linnaeus in the 18th century.

>> ○ Genus - Species - Namer

> ③ Trinomial Nomenclature

>> ○ Used for subspecies, varieties, and cultivars.

>> ○ Genus - Species - (Subspecies, Variety, Cultivar) - Namer

> ④ Writing scientific names

>> ○ Genus **:** Capitalized, italicized

>> ○ Species **:** Lowercase, italicized

>> ○ Subspecies, Variety, Cultivar **:** Lowercase, italicized

>>> ○ Variety indicated by "var."

>>> ○ Cultivar indicated by "for."

>> ○ Namer **:** Capitalized, regular font; can be omitted or only the first letter of the namer's name can be used.

>> ○ Example, Tiger **:** _Felis tiger_ Linne

>> ○ Example, Korean Tiger (Subspecies) **:** _Felis tiger coreansis_ Brass

>> ○ Taq polymerase is derived from the thermophilic archaeon Thermus aquaticus.

> ⑦ rRNA sequences are more similar between Archaea and Eukarya than between Archaea and Bacteria → Eukarya and Archaea have a closer relationship.
