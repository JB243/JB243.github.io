**Figure 3.** Alpha helix structure

<br>

> ① Hydrogen bonds between C=O of nth amino acid and N-H of n+4th amino acid

> ② Resilient, right-handed helix

> ③ Characteristics: Hydrogen bonds are present within amino acids, but not between amino acids

> ④ Hydrophilic amino acids hinder alpha helix formation due to van der Waals and steric effects

>> ○ Conclusion: Hydrophobic amino acids mainly form alpha helices

>> ○ Frequently observed in membrane-spanning proteins

> ⑤ Gly: Side chain R is a hydrogen, preventing proper alpha helix formation due to its small size

> ⑥ Pro: Forms an imino group, limiting hydrogen bonding → prevents alpha helix formation

⑵ Different structures arise due to interactions between R groups. Differences in structure determine properties

⑶ Ionic bonds

⑷ Covalent Bond

⑸ Disulfide Bridge: Contributes to a more stable conformation

> ① Reducing Agent: Breaks disulfide bridges. Examples: β-mercaptoethanol, DTT (dithiothreitol)

> ② In endoplasmic reticulum for eukaryotic cells. In the cytoplasm for prokaryotic cells, PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) is formed.

> ③ **Anfinsen's Experiment**

>> ○ NEM (N-ethylmaleimide): Binds to -SH groups not involved in disulfide bridges.

>> ○ DTT (including β-mercaptoethanol): -S-S- → -SH + HS-. Functions as a reducing agent to break disulfide bonds.

>> ○ NEM* → DTT → NEM: Quantifies the initially present SH groups. * indicates radioactive isotope.

>> ○ NEM → DTT → NEM*: Quantifies the initially present -S-S- bonds. * indicates radioactive isotope.

>> ○ **Conclusion 1:** When denaturing factors are removed, proteins revert to their original structure.

>> ○ **Conclusion 2:** Disulfide bridges contribute irreversibly to the formation of conformation, requiring precise control.
