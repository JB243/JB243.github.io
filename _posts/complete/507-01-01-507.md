## **1. Overall**

> ○ Social science and history have diversified concepts (_e.g._, politics, society, culture, economy, science, etc.), and are not clear at all (_e.g._, there are many overlapping concepts in the different flow of events and even ambiguous concepts for which extra category should be prepared). On the other hand, mathematics has a very tight and systematic monolithic development method. To account for the difference, which of the following three reasons is most relevant: 1) the fact that the information is fundamentally different, 2) the diversity of people, and 3) the free will.

> ○ Since the knowledge transferred to the people is increasing, isn't history continuing to advance? Why did socialism fail when it had historical materialism which also contains a concept of continuous development of history?

> ○ Will humanity survive a thousand years later?

> ○ Technological advances will not last forever, but how can a society without technological advances achieve innovation?

> ○ What can hold people's hearts today when religion and widespread war have disappeared?

> ○ Who will rule the people in an age without a king?

> ○ Is a low birth rate the path that all developed countries should take?

> ○ If a country colonizes, is the colony always eventually independent of its home country?

> ○ Is there a theory that predicts the direction of history? Why is the power-rule always observed in consequence?

> ○ Is the realm of history in unpredictable territory? Is a principle similar to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics observed in historical science?

> ○ Can biological evolution explain human history?

> ○ Will China's GDP outpace that of the United States? Is game theory considered in the graph below?

> ○ Eventually, will humans be replaced by machines by natural selection?

> ○ Can Thomas Kuhn's scientific revolution be explained by evolutionary theory?

> ○ Can evolution be a theory that explains history?

> ○ What is the average lifespan of a civilization? How long is the lifespan of mankind?

> ○ Is the lifespan of human, or history of a civilization, akin to a steady-state equilibrium?

<br>

## **2. Korean History**

> ○ What is the reason for the rapid growth of the Republic of Korea? 

>> ➜ The initial rapid growth was due to 1) the policy centered on conglomerates that started with Lee Seung Man's government, 2) the fact that when labor costs were low, it had 3 boons, and 3) the Korean's sentinent that had been concentrated on the war during the past 5000 years and was focused purely on the economic growth. The late rapid growth was due to 1) the special interest of semiconductors, 2) the specificity of the Korean people without invasion, _i.e._ the nature of good people, and 3) the geopolitical specificity. Currently, South Korea is experiencing the richest point in its history.

> ○ Is the history of democratization in South Korea due to the increased purchasing power of the people? 

>> ➜ Considering the fact that the uprising continued even in Korea's poorest moments, it is right to regard it as a characteristic of many Koreans.

> ○ Korea has been very enthusiastic about education since ancient times. Is the reason of Korea's enthusiasim about education that it tries to raise its status from within rather than from without such as through war or invasion?

<br>

<br>

## **3. Economic History**

> ○ Is population growth constrained by land according to Malthusian theory?

>> **➜ According to the law of increasing returns of scale, population growth promotes technological development, increasing the output of land exponentially, thereby eliminating practical land constraints. Therefore, population growth is not constrained by land.**

> ○ The increase in per capita GDP or an amount of knowledge can be divided into two periods. The early phase of linear growth is known to have been driven by the Renaissance (1455-1517), and the late phase of exponential growth is known to have been driven by the Industrial Revolution (1776-1815). What drives the economy in 20 years?

> ○ What jobs were prestigious 100 years ago? And what jobs are being prestigious for each country?

> ○ Does macroeconomic or economic history belong to unpredictable areas like the principle of uncertainty in quantum mechanics?

> ○ Does the development of technology imply the loss of old technology? Will AI destroy many technologies (_e.g._, art) in the future?
