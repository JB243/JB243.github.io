## **1\. Fatty Acids**

⑴ Characteristics

> ① Serum albumin aids in the movement of fatty acids in the blood plasma.

> ② Unsaturated fatty acids: Used in the synthesis of new substances, incapable of beta oxidation.

⑵ **Type 1.** Saturated Fatty Acids

> ① **1-1.** Lauric Acid (12:0)

>> ○ 12 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ② **1-2.** Myristic Acid (14: 0)

>> ○ 14 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ③ **1-3.** Palmitic Acid (16:0)

>> ○ 16 carbons, 0 double bonds

> ④ **1-4.** Stearic Acid (18:0)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 0 double bonds

⑶ **Type 2.** Unsaturated Fatty Acids

> ① **2-1.** Palmitoleic Acid (16:1)

>> ○ 16 carbons, 1 double bond

>> ○ ω-7: Alkene formation starting from the 7th carbon from the methyl end

> ② **2-2.** Oleic Acid (18:1)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 1 double bond

>> ○ ω-9: Alkene formation starting from the 9th carbon from the methyl end

> ③ **2-3.** Linoleic Acid (18:2)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 2 double bonds

>> ○ ω-6: Alkene formation starting from the 6th carbon from the methyl end

> ④ **2-4.** α-Linolenic Acid (18:3)

>> ○ 18 carbons, 3 double bonds

>> ○ ω-3: Alkene formation starting from the 3rd carbon from the methyl end

>> ○ Found in vegetables and plant oils (corn oil)

>> ○ Prevents skin diseases and possesses growth factors

> ⑤ **2-5.** Arachidonic Acid (20:4)

>> ○ 20 carbons, 4 double bonds

>> ○ ω-6: Alkene formation starting from the 6th carbon from the methyl end

>> ○ Present in animal fats and prevents skin diseases

> ⑥ Omega-3 Fatty Acids

>> ○ Unsaturated fatty acids that form the first alkene from the 3rd carbon from the methyl end

>> ○ Promotes platelet aggregation, stimulates prostaglandin production, preventing heart disease, and possibly cancer prevention

>> ○ EPA, DHA: Rich sources in fish for omega-3 fatty acids

>> ○ DHA: Beneficial for young children's brain development

> ⑦ Linoleic Acid → Arachidonic Acid

> ⑧ Arachidonic Acid → PG, Thromboxane

>> ○ Mediating enzyme: C.O.X

>> ○ PG: Increases blood clotting, causes headaches, uterine contractions, raises the set point, promotes gastric mucosal formation

>> ○ Thromboxane: Blood clotting

>> ○ Arachidonic Acid → Leukotrienes

>> ○ PG, Thromboxane, Leukotrienes: Self-decomposition

## **2\. Steroids**

⑴ Cholesterol: 3 hexagonal rings + 1 pentagonal ring + -OH

> ① Distributed regularly in and out of membranes

> ② Stabilizes membranes

> ③ Precursor

>> ○ Adrenal cortex hormones, Vitamin D

>> ○ Vitamin D: Activates calcium pumps in the intestine, increasing calcium absorption

> ④ Cholesterol is absent in the cell membrane of E. coli

## **3. Glycolipids**

⑴ Four major components of animal cell membranes, accounting for over 50%, Phosphatidylcholine, Phosphatidylethanolamine, Phosphatidylserine, Sphingomyelin

⑵ Asymmetry of Glycolipids involves flippase and floppase

> ① Charge imbalance: Outside of the cell membrane is positively charged, inside is negatively charged

> ② Ligand imbalance: Phosphatidylcholine, Phosphatidylinositol, Phosphatidylserine, etc.

⑶ **Type 1.** Glycosphingolipids: Glycerol skeleton + Glycolipid × 2 + Phosphate × 1 + Substituent × 1

> ① Phosphatidylcholine: _External cell glycolipid_, positively charged

> ② Phosphatidylethanolamine: _Internal cell glycolipid_

> ③ Phosphatidylinositol: _Internal cell glycolipid_, negatively charged

> ④ Phosphatidylserine: _Internal cell glycolipid_, neutral, cell fate when asymmetry is destroyed

⑷ **Type 2.** Sphingolipids: Sphingosine skeleton + Sphingosine tail × 1 + Glycolipid × 1 + Phosphate × 1 + Substituent × 1, _External cell glycolipid_

> ① Synthesis

>> ○ **Step 1.** Amino group of sphingosine is acylated

>> ○ **Step 2.** Ceramide

>> ○ **Step 3.** Sphingomyelin, cerebroside, ganglioside

> ② **Role 1.** Used to anchor receptors, transporter-dense regions (lipid rafts), low mobility glycolipids

>> ○ Lipid raft: ↑ Cholesterol, ↑ Sphingolipids, ↑ Saturated fatty acids, ↑ Fatty acid chain length, Carbohydrates present

>> ○ Major recognition glycoproteins are also distributed in lipid rafts

> ③ **Role 2.** Formation of neuron axons

> ④ **Role 3.** ABO blood type antigens

⑸ **Type 3.** Glycosphingolipids

⑹ **Type 4.** Liposomes: Applied in drug delivery

> ① General size: Diameter of 90 nm

⑺ **Type 5.** Platelet Activating Factor (PAF): Ether-linked

⑻ Glycolipids are also located in _external cell glycolipids_ for cell-cell recognition.
