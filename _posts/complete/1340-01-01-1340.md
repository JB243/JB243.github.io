## **1\. Definitions of Liquids and Solids**

 ⑴ Definition of a Liquid is more ambiguous than that of a Gas or Solid

> ① Gas **:** Almost no intermolecular forces

> ② Solid **:** Particles are fixed in space

> ③ Liquid **:** Fluidic but can't escape from each other, also used when defining the concept of meniscus

 ⑵ Definition based on Arrangement (Ordering)

> ① Gas **:** No ordering

> ② Solid **:** Long-range ordering

> ③ Liquid **:** Short-range ordering

 ⑶ Definition based on Vibrational Amplitude

> ① Gas

> ② Solid **:** When particles vibrate less than half the distance between them in a crystalline structure

> ③ Liquid **:** When particles vibrate more than half the distance between them in a crystalline structure

 ⑷ Liquid Crystal **:** A state where liquid maintains ordering like a solid

> ① Nematic Phase **:** Alignment in the same direction, not orderly

> ② Smectic Phase **:** Alignment in the same direction with regular spacing

> ③ Cholesteric Phase **:** When the next layer is tilted at a certain angle to the previous layer

 ⑵ [Viscosity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/933)

 ⑶ Vapor Pressure

> ① Vapor Pressure and Boiling Point

>> ○ Vapor Pressure **:** Pressure exerted by vapor when evaporation and condensation of a liquid reach equilibrium

>> ○ Boiling Point **:** Pressure at which vapor pressure of a liquid equals the external pressure

>>> ○ Normal Boiling Point (Tb) **:** Boiling point at 1 atmosphere pressure

> ② Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (e.g., water)

> ③ Temperature and Raoult's Law

>> ○ Transition from vapor phase (steam) to gas phase (vapor) is an endothermic process, i.e., ΔH < 0

>> ○ Increase in temperature ⇒ Equilibrium shift towards endothermic reaction according to Raoult's Law ⇒ Increase in equilibrium constant (K) ⇒ Increase in vapor pressure

> ④ Clausius-Clapeyron Equation

>> ○ Formulation **:** For absolute temperature (T)

>> ○ Derivation

>> ○ Vapor pressures at different temperatures

>> ○ Calculation of enthalpy of vaporization and entropy of vaporization

>>> ○ Assumption **:** Enthalpy and entropy of vaporization do not change with temperature

>>> ○ Enthalpy of vaporization calculation **:** Calculate slope from ln P - 1/T curve and multiply by (-R)

> ⑤ Antoine Equation **:** Empirical equation to calculate vapor pressure

 ⑷ Freezing Phenomenon

> ① Definition **:** Phenomenon where a substance does not solidify even as the temperature goes below its freezing point, i.e., supercooling (e.g., water)

> ② Principle **:** Water takes a long time to form its hexagonal structure, preventing freezing below its freezing point
