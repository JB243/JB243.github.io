## **1** **. Simple Harmonic Motion** 

 ⑴ Definition **:** Mechanical motion of an object exhibiting wave-like properties.

 ⑵ Cause **:** Simple harmonic motion occurs when a system is acted upon by both a restoring force and inertia.

> ① Restoring Force **:** Generates a force proportional to displacement.

> ② Obtained through differential equations like y" + Ky = 0, where K > 0 is common.

>> ○ The y" term originates from F = ma.

>> ○ The Ky term arises from the fact that the restoring force is proportional to the change in displacement.

> ③ Total energy due to restoring force

>> ○ E = K + U

>> ○ E = ½ kA2, where A is the amplitude (maximum displacement).

> ④ Potential U due to restoring force

>> ○ Relationship between potential and force **:** F = -∇U

>> ○ Since the restoring force F ∝ x, U ∝ x^2

>>> ○ Potential due to restoring force is lowest at equilibrium, increasing with greater changes in displacement.

>> ○ Stable, Unstable

>>> ○ Stable equilibrium point **:** U" > 0 (concave downward), U' (x=0) = 0

>>> ○ Unstable equilibrium point **:** U" < 0 (concave upward), U' (x=0) = 0

 ⑶ Examples

> ① **Example 1:** Simple Harmonic Oscillation (단진동)

>> ○ Definition **:** Motion where an object undergoes back-and-forth motion parallel to the ground using a spring that can be treated as massless.

>> ○ Derivation **:** Utilizing the fact that external force = restoring force = elastic force, solving second-order differential equations.

>> ○ Conclusion **:** The period T of the spring solely depends on mass m and the spring constant k.

> ② **Example 2:** Simple Pendulum (단진자)

>> ○ Motion where a mass is hung on a string with negligible mass, oscillating with a small amplitude.

>> ○ The period T of the pendulum solely depends on the length ℓ of the string.

>> ○ Physical pendulum **:** When a rigid body is rotated around an axis in a gravitational field, resulting in simple harmonic motion.

>>> Note: I is the moment of inertia of the body about the rotation axis, h is the distance from the rotation axis to the center of mass.

> ③ **Example 3:** LC Circuit

> ④ **Example 4:** Atomic Vibrations

 ⑷ Nonlinear Effect

> ① A phenomenon where the mechanical system departs from proportionality between the restoring force and displacement due to large changes from equilibrium.

> ② Observed when modified simple harmonic motion occurs.

## **2.** **Application 1:** Simple Harmonic Motion of an Object Hanging on a Spring Under Gravity

 ⑴ When the mass of the spring is ignored

> ① For an object with mass m, elongation x (which can be negative) from the natural length of the spring in the direction of gravity,

>> ○ Φ **:** Initial phase

>> ○ xm **:** Amplitude (maximum displacement)

> ② Initial conditions **:** Assuming v = x = 0 at t = 0

> ③ **Tip 1:** The center of simple harmonic motion is where the elastic force and gravity are in equilibrium.

> ④ **Tip 2:** The amplitude of simple harmonic motion is determined by initial conditions: the distance from the initial position to the center of the motion.

> ⑤ **Tip 3:** The period of simple harmonic motion is not affected by initial velocity, elongation, or gravitational acceleration.

 ⑵ When the mass of the spring is considered ([ref](http://physlab.snu.ac.kr/documents/manual/Ko/1-7.pdf))

> ① **Condition 1:** Mass of the weight M, mass of the spring m, spring constant k, spring length L, distance from the attachment point of the spring L

> ② **Condition 2:** The spring is uniform, L ≫ elongation x

> ③ Under force equilibrium, elongation x(y) (≪ y) from 0 to point y is given as follows

> ④ This equation assumes that the spring has no mass, and elongation is constant while the spring constant varies with position.

> ⑤ The average spring constant is calculated as follows

> ⑥ When m ≪ M, using the Taylor series of ln (1 + x),

> ⑦ An approximate value for the period is as follows; using (1 + x)-1 ≒ 1 - x

> ⑧ More accurate calculations become exceedingly complex.
