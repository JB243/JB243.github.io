## **1\. Nomenclature**

⑴ Official Nomenclature

> ① Take an alkane with a higher number of carbon atoms as the main chain.

> ② Name the remaining portion other than the parent main as alkoxy

> ③ Number the carbon in the main chain connected to the alkoxy group as 1

> ④ If there are multiple substituents in the main chain, name them in alphabetical order

>> ○ Example: (3_S_, 4_R_)-3-butoxy-4-methylhexane

> ⑤ Examples

>> ○ 2-methoxybutane

>> ○ 1-ethoxy-3-methylpentane

>> ○ 1-butoxy-2,3-dimethylpentane

>> ○ 1,4-diisopropoxybutane

⑵ Common Nomenclature

> ① Write the names of substituents on both sides of the ether oxygen in alphabetical order and add the term "-ether".

> ② Examples

>> ○ ethyl methyl ether

>> ○ diethyl ether (ethyl ether)

>> ○ diphenyl ether

>> ○ _tert_-butyl isobutyl ether

>> ○ _sec_-butyl isopropyl ether

>> ○ cyclohexyl isopentyl ether

## **2\. Reactions**

⑴ Low Reactivity

> ① Ethers are often used as solvents due to their limited reactivity

> ② Examples of solvents used

>> ○ diethyl ether: also known as ether

>> ○ tetrahydrofuran: also known as THF

>> ○ tetrahydropyran: also known as THP

>> ○ 1,4-dioxane

>> ○ 1,2-dimethoxyethane: also known as DME

>> ○ _tert_ -butyl methyl ether: also known as MTBE

⑵ **Reaction 1.** Decomposition by HX

> ① HI and HBr readily react, while HCl reacts less readily

> ② S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction: Nucleophiles attack ethers that do not contain tertiary carbons, considering steric hindrance

> ③ S<sub>N</sub>1 Reaction: Ethers containing tertiary carbons result in carbocation formation at the tertiary carbon

> ④ Phenyl Groups Present

>> ○ Phenyl alkyl ethers: Decomposition between oxygen and phenyl does not occur. However, under HBr or BBr3, phenolization can occur

>> ○ Biphenyl ethers: Ether decomposition does not occur

⑶ **Reaction 2.** Hydrolysis by H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>

> ① Ether Formation: ROH + R'OH → ROR'

> ② Under strong acidic conditions, reverse reaction to ROH and R'OH can occur

⑷ **Reaction 3.** Protection of THP Ether: Ether protection using DHP (dihydropyran)

> ① Protection Step

> ② Deprotection Step

⑸ **Reaction 4.** Claisen Rearrangement Reaction

> ① Reactants: allyl vinyl ether or allyl phenyl ether

⑹ **Reaction 5.** Crown Ethers

> ① Also called phase transfer catalysts, ion carriers, quaternary ammonium salts, cryptands

> ② Named as 3n-crown-n-ether due to the repeating CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O structure

> ③ Form complexes with different ions based on their pore sizes: Can transport cations after coordination, in nonpolar solvents

>> ○ Li<sup>+</sup>: 12-crown-4-ether (n=4)

>> ○ Na<sup>+</sup>: 15-crown-5-ether (n=5)

>> ○ K<sup>+</sup>: 18-crown-6-ether (n=6)

>> ○ Example: KF doesn't dissolve in acetonitrile, but crown ether ionizes K<sup>+</sup> and captures F<sup>-</sup> ions

## **3. [Synthesis Methods](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1372)**

⑴ Synthesis of Symmetrical Ethers

> ① Summary: Elimination reactions dominate at high temperatures, while addition reactions dominate at low temperatures

> ② (_not desirable_) H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 180°C: R-CH<sub>2</sub>OH + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → R=CH<sub>2</sub>. [Alcohol E1 Elimination Reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1372#:~:text=%E2%91%B8-,1%2D4.%20E1%20%EB%B0%98%EC%9D%91,-%E2%91%A0%20%EC%8B%9C%EC%95%BD%20%3A%20H2SO4%2C%20H3PO4)

<br>

> ③ (_desirable_) H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 140°C: R-CH<sub>2</sub>OH + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → R-CH<sub>2</sub>-O-CH<sub>2</sub>-R

<br>

**Figure 3.** Successful synthesis of symmetrical ethers

<br>

> ④ Drawback: Synthesis of symmetrical ethers yields various ethers (ROR, R'OR, R'OR'), making it unsuitable

> ⑤ Exceptionally, successful synthesis of unsymmetrical ethers is achieved using a tertiary alcohol as one component (**∵** S<sub>N</sub>1 Reaction)

⑵ Williamson Ether Synthesis: Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Ethers

> ① Mechanism

>> ○ **Step 1.** ROH + NaH → RO<sup>-</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ **Step 2.** RO<sup>-</sup> + R'I → ROR' + I<sup>-</sup> (S<sub>N</sub>2): Stereochemistry of R' is inverted

<br>

**Figure 4.** Mechanism of Williamson Ether Synthesis

<br>

> ② **(Formula)** Reaction of alcohol under NaH, R'X conditions can be considered as an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction

> ③ Limitation: If R'X is not a methyl halide or primary halide alkyl, elimination reaction dominates, making it unsuitable

⑶ Alkoxy Mercuration-Demercuration

> ① Overview

>> ○ Useful when Williamson Ether Synthesis is not applicable

>> ○ Alkoxy mercuration-demercuration is Markovnikov hydration where ROH is the reactant

>> ○ Similar to [oxymercuration-demercuration](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363) of alkenes

> ② **(Formula)** Reaction under 1. Hg(O<sub>2</sub>CCF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, ROH, 2. NaBH<sub>4</sub>, HO<sup>-</sup> conditions

> ③ Mechanism

**Figure 5.** Mechanism of Alkoxy Mercuration-Demercuration

<br>

>> ○ Hg exposes inner electrons to create a cyclic intermediate

>> ○ ROH, being a weak nucleophile, performs an S<sub>N</sub>1-like reaction, attacking the carbon with multiple substitutions
