**Figure 1.** The Principle of Characteristic X-rays

<br>

>> ○ K: Electron shell with n = 1.

>> ○ L: Electron shell with n = 2.

>> ○ M: Electron shell with n = 3.

> ③ The term "characteristic" is used to indicate that a common peak is observed regardless of the type of scintillating material.

> ④ These X-rays can be applied to Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).

 ⑷ Gas Chromatography (GC)

> ① Definition: The method in which the evaporated sample components are separated by being distributed between the stationary phase in the column and the mobile gas phase.

> ② Inert gases like helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, argon are commonly used as carrier gases. Helium is mainly used as the gas phase.

>> ○ **Reason 1:** Lighter gas molecules like H<sub>2</sub>, He have higher diffusion coefficients, leading to faster separation

>> ○ **Reason 2:** Lighter gas molecules like H<sub>2</sub>, He have higher thermal conductivity, reducing preheating time

>> ○ **Reason 3:** Gases like H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> can react with the sample

> ③ Advantages: High resolution

> ④ Disadvantages: Analyzing non-volatile compounds is challenging; suitable for small molecular weights (typically 10<sup>0</sup> - 10<sup>3</sup>)

> ⑤ **Application 1:** Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLC) and Gas-Solid Chromatography (GSC)

> ⑥ **Application 2:** Measuring molecular weights through gas chromatography: using correlation between retention time and molecular weight 

> ⑦ **Application 3:** Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrography (GC-MS)

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> Step: Separated substances from gas chromatography are electronically ionized or chemically ionized for mass-dependent classification

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> Step: Separated substances form unique mass spectra

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> Step: Structure information is obtained by comparing with accumulated library data or quantitative analysis

>> ○ Can also be used for quantifying trace components by selecting 1st ions and performing 2nd ionization

 ⑸ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)

> ① Measures presence and molecular weight of trace substances using the difference in movement distance on a stationary phase in chromatography

> ② Molecular weight conditions: 6 × 10<sup>1</sup> ~ 10<sup>4</sup>

> ③ Comprises solvent, pump, injector, column, detector, recorder

> ④ Most common detector in HPLC is UV detector

> ⑤ Refractive Index (RI) detector is sensitive to environmental changes like pressure and temperature, but not very sensitive to solutes

 ⑹ Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)

> ① ICP: Introduces the sample into argon plasma formed by high-frequency induction coil, measures emitted spectral lines and intensity at 6000 ~ 8000 K when atoms in ground state move to excited state

> ② Electrons move to ground state within 10<sup>-7</sup> ~ 10<sup>-8</sup> seconds

> ③ Emits light with energy difference, which is diffracted and intensity measured

> ④ **Application 1:** ICP-MS

## **4. Experimental Techniques**

 ⑴ Fundamentals of Chemical Experiments

> ① Experiments with toxic gases are conducted in a hood

> ② Dilute sulfuric acid is prepared by adding water to a beaker before adding concentrated sulfuric acid

> ③ When transferring concentrated hydrochloric acid, use a glass rod to guide the acid along the beaker wall

> ④ Due to sodium hydroxide's high moisture absorption, accurate weighing is challenging

> ⑤ The produced NaOH solution is not stored in glass containers for long periods

> ⑥ If a mercury thermometer breaks, sprinkle sufficient sulfur to absorb the mercury vapor and collect it after a day

 ⑵ Volumetric Analysis and Standardization of Solutions

> ① Volumetric analysis: Experimental method to determine the amount of unknown sample

>> ○ Burette: Instrument for measuring volumes

>> ○ Add a solution of known concentration until

 the sample is completely consumed using a burette

>> ○ Utilize reactions that can immediately conclude when solution is added with the burette

> ② Standardization

>> ○ Primary Standard Substance: Substance with a specific concentration of solution that can be accurately prepared and used

>>> ○ **Condition 1:** Obtainable in pure state (constant composition)

>>> ○ **Condition 2:** Easy to purify

>>> ○ **Condition 3:** High molecular weight for accurate mass measurement

>> ○ Standard Solution: Solution that undergoes standardization using primary standard substance for volumetric analysis

>> ○ Standardization Process: Using the solution of primary standard substance to accurately measure the concentration of the solution for volumetric analysis

>>> ○ Example: Using a solution of primary standard substance potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) to measure the concentration of NaOH(aq), where NaOH is the standard solution

 ⑶ Direct and Indirect Titration

> ① Direct Titration: Method of directly determining the amount of analyte

>> ○ **Condition 1:** Rapid reaction between analyte and standard solution

>> ○ **Condition 2:** Complete reaction

>> ○ **Condition 3:** Suitable indicator available at equivalence point

>> ○ Example 1: Measuring the concentration of acetic acid using NaOH standard solution

>>> CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O

>> ○ Example 2: Measuring the concentration of Cl- using AgNO3 standard solution

>>> Ag+ + Cl- → AgCl

> ② Indirect Titration: Used when direct titration conditions are not met

>> ○ Substitution Titration: Adding excess of a solution that reacts with the interfering substance to remove it

>>> ○ Example: Quantification of metal cations using EDTA

>>>> ○ **Step 1:** Add magnesium's EDTA chelate compound (MgY2-) to a solution containing metal cation Mn+

>>>>> MgY2- + Mn+ → MYn-4 + Mg2+

>>>> ○ **Step 2:** Titrate the resulting excess Mg2+ with EDTA

>>>> ○ Eriochrome Black T or Calmagite can be used as indicators

>>>> ○ The molar amount of Mg2+ measured in **Step 2** equals the molar amount of Mn+ present in the original solution

>> ○ Back Titration: Adding excess standard solution and titrating the remaining substance

>>> ○ Used when direct reaction between analyte and standard solution is slow

>>> ○ Example 1: Quantification of Ni2+ using back titration

>>>> ○ **Step 1:** Add excess EDTA standard solution to the sample solution containing Ni2+ ions

>>>>> Ni2+ + Y4- → NiY2-

>>>> ○ **Step 2:** After the reaction is complete, titrate the remaining EDTA to quantify the concentration of Ni2+

>>>>>> Mg2+ + Y4- → MgY2-

>>>> ○ **Step 3:** Mg2+ forms a complex with Eriochrome Black T indicator, changing color from blue to violet

>>>> ○ The molar amount of Ni2+ in the initial solution is the difference between the molar amount of EDTA added in **Step 1** and the molar amount of EDTA measured in **Step 2**

>> ○ Example 2: DNP Method (2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine colorimetric method)

>>> ○ **Step 1:** Under sulfuric acid, oxidation substance and DNP undergo dehydration reaction to form bi-2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazone

>>> ○ **Step 2:** Quantify oxidizing substance by colorimetrically measuring bi-2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazone of matching color

 ⑷ Removal of Interfering Substances

> ① Masking Agent: Substance that prevents unwanted reactions (side reactions) from occurring

> ② Induces reactions to remove substances participating in side reactions

>> ○ Example: Quantification of copper in steel samples

>>> ○ Main reaction for quantification: Cu2+ + 2I- → Cu + I2

>>> ○ Undesirable reaction: 2Fe3+ + 6I- → 2Fe + 3I2

>>> ○ Adding F- acts as masking agent, preventing the side reaction by forming FeF3(s)

> ③ Separation by Precipitation

> ④ Separation by Acid-Base Regulation

>> ○ Solubility of hydroxides and acids varies with solution pH

>> ○ Adjusting solution pH can dissolve hydroxides for separation

> ⑤ Separation Using Solvent Extraction

>> ○ Chemical species distribute differently between immiscible solvents

>> ○ One solvent can extract the substance from the other
