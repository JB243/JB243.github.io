## **1. Wild-type Male and Female Drosophila Structure**

 ⑴ **Structure 1.** Head

> ① Has a pair of antennae.

> ② Has a pair of red eyes: Compound eyes, unlike human eyes.

 ⑵ **Structure 2.** Thorax

> ① Divided into three parts.

> ② Each segment has a pair of legs.

> ③ A pair of halteres is attached to the second thoracic segment.

> ④ Third thoracic segment has vestigial halteres called halters.

> ⑤ Halters help in maintaining balance during flight.

 ⑶ **Structure 3.** Abdomen

  ⑷ Sexual Dimorphism

> ① Males have a structure called sexcomb on the first leg.

> ② The posterior part of the male abdomen is black, unlike females.

## **2. Drosophila Mutants**

  ⑴ White Eye Mutant (w, white)

<br>

**Figure. 1.** White Eye Mutant]

> ① Discovered by Morgan in 1910 through natural variation.

> ② **Type 1.** w1 mutant allele

>> ○ First mutant allele discovered.

>> ○ Obtained through natural variation.

>> ○ Protein produced from this gene is involved in synthesizing pigment granules on the eye membrane.

>> ○ Located at the 3C2 position of the third chromosome.

> ③ **Type 2.** w118 mutant allele

>> ○ Obtained through natural variation.

>> ○ Protein produced from this gene is involved in synthesizing pigment granules on the eye membrane.

>> ○ More commonly used than w1 allele.

>> ○ Located at the 3C2 position of the third chromosome.

  ⑵ Bar Eye Mutant (B, bar)

<br>

**Figure. 2.** Bar Eye Mutant]

> ① Discovered by Tice in 1914 through X-ray.

> ② Located on the X chromosome.

>> ○ Position: 16A1-2 on the third chromosome.

> ③ Normal gene duplicated, leading to the development of bar eye phenotype.

>> ○ Wild-type males have around 740 individual facets per eye, while females have around 780.

>> ○ Bar-eyed mutants have around 90 facets in males and around 70 facets in homozygous females.

  ⑶ Vestigial Wing Sepia Eye Mutant (vg se, vestigial sepia)

<br>

**Figure. 3.** Vestigial Wing Sepia Eye Mutant]

> ① Double mutant.

> ② **Component 1.** Vestigial wing gene

>> ○ Discovered by Morgan and Bridge in 1919 through natural variation.

>> ○ Located on the second chromosome: Position 49D2-E1 on the third chromosome.

>> ○ Inherited in a recessive manner.

>> ○ Mainly involved in wing margin development.

>> ○ Drosophila primarily exhibits wing spreading in the vestigial form.

>> ○ At temperatures above 29°C, wings become elongated.

> ③ **Component 2.** Sepia eye gene

>> ○ Discovered by Wallace in 1923 through natural variation.

>> ○ Located on the second chromosome.

>> ○ Inherited in a recessive manner.

>> ○ Encodes an enzyme that converts red pigment granules into other intermediate products.

>> ○ Newly emerged flies show brown color but darken with age.

  ⑷ Antennapedia Ebony Mutant (Antp e, antennapedia ebony)

<br>

<br>

**Figure. 4.** Antennapedia Ebony Mutant]

> ① Double mutant.

> ② **Component 1.** Antennapedia leg gene

>> ○ First discovered by Abbot using X-ray.

>> ○ Later discovered by Green through natural variation (commonly used).

>> ○ Located on the third chromosome: Position 85B1-2 on the third chromosome.

>> ○ Inherited in a dominant manner.

>> ○ Essential homeotic gene for development, determining leg formation from thorax.

>> ○ Homeosis or homeotic transformation occurs.

> ③ **Component 2.** Ebony body gene

>> ○ Discovered by Wallace in 1923 through natural variation.

>> ○ Located on the third chromosome: Position 93D2-6 on the third chromosome.

>> ○ Inherited in a dominant manner.

>> ○ Encodes β-alanyl dopamine synthetase enzyme, promoting synthesis of β-alanyl dopamine from dopamine and β-alanine with the help of ATP and MgCl2.

  ⑸ Curly Wing Mutant (Cy, curly)

 **Figure. 7.** Sketch of Calvin B. Bridge's Salivary Gland Chromosomes

  ⑴ Salivary gland chromosomes are clustered together in chromocenters.

  ⑵ This clustering facilitates the production of glue required for pupation.

  ⑶ Salivary gland chromosomes have a polytene structure with 1024 strands.

  ⑷ Salivary glands undergo degeneration during metamorphosis.
