## **1. Wild-type Male and Female Drosophila Structure**

⑴ **Structure 1.** Head

> ① Has a pair of antennae.

> ② Has a pair of red eyes: Compound eyes, unlike human eyes.

 ⑵ **Structure 2.** Thorax

> ① Divided into three parts.

> ② Each segment has a pair of legs.

> ③ A pair of wings is attached to the second thoracic segment.

> ④ The third thoracic segment has a haltere, a reduced and modified wing.

> ⑤ The halteres help maintain balance during flight.

⑶ **Structure 3.** Abdomen

⑷ Sexual Dimorphism

> ① Males have a structure called sexcomb on the first leg.

> ② The posterior part of the male abdomen is black, unlike females.

## **2. Drosophila Mutants**

⑴ White Eye Mutant (w, white)

**Figure 1.** White Eye Mutant

<br>

> ① Morgan discovered it in 1910 through natural occurrence.

> ② **Type 1.** w<sup>1</sup> mutant allele

>> ○ First mutant allele discovered.

>> ○ Obtained through natural occurrence.

>> ○ The protein produced by this gene is membrane-bound and involved in synthesizing pigment precursors.

>> ○ It is located at the 3C2 position of the polytene chromosome.

> ③ **Type 2.** w<sup>118</sup> mutant allele

>> ○ Obtained through natural occurrence.

>> ○ The protein produced by this gene is membrane-bound and involved in synthesizing pigment precursors.

>> ○ More commonly used than w<sup>1</sup> allele.

>> ○ It is located at the 3C2 position of the polytene chromosome.

⑵ Bar Eye Mutant (B, bar)

**Figure 2.** Bar Eye Mutant

<br>

> ① Discovered by Tice in 1914 through X-ray.

> ② Located on the X chromosome.

>> ○ It is located at the 16A1-2 position of the polytene chromosome.

> ③ A normal gene is duplicated, resulting in the bar-eye phenotype.

>> ○ A normal male has approximately 740 ommatidia, while a normal female has about 780.  

>> ○ In the bar-eye mutation, males have about 90 ommatidia, and homozygous females have about 70.  

⑶ Vestigial Wing Sepia Eye Mutant (vg se, vestigial sepia)

**Figure 3.** Vestigial Wing Sepia Eye Mutant

<br>

> ① Double mutant.

> ② **Component 1.** Vestigial wing gene

>> ○ Discovered by Morgan and Bridge in 1919 through natural occurrence.

>> ○ Located on the second chromosome: It is located at the 49D2-E1 position of the polytene chromosome.

>> ○ Inherited in a recessive manner.

>> ○ Mainly involved in wing margin development.

>> ○ Drosophila primarily exhibits wing spreading in the vestigial form.

>> ○ At temperatures above 29°C, wings become elongated.

> ③ **Component 2.** Sepia eye gene

>> ○ Discovered by Wallace in 1923 through natural occurrence.

>> ○ Located on the second chromosome.

>> ○ Inherited in a recessive manner.

>> ○ Encodes an enzyme that converts the red pigment precursor into other intermediate products.  

>> ○ Newly emerged pupae appear brown, but they gradually darken with age.

⑷ Antennapedia Ebony Mutant (Antp e, antennapedia ebony)

**Figure 4.** Antennapedia Ebony Mutant

<br>

> ① Double mutant.

> ② **Component 1.** Antennapedia gene

>> ○ First discovered by Abbot using X-ray.

>> ○ Later discovered by Green through natural occurrence (commonly used).

>> ○ Located on the third chromosome: It is located at the 85B1-2 position of the polytene chromosome.

>> ○ Inherited in a dominant manner.

>> ○ Homeotic genes, which are crucial for animal development, are normally expressed in the thorax to determine structures such as legs.  

>> ○ Homeosis or homeotic transformation occurs.

> ③ **Component 2.** Ebony body gene

>> ○ Discovered by Wallace in 1923 through natural occurrence.

>> ○ Located on the third chromosome: It is located at the 93D2-6 position of the polytene chromosome.

>> ○ Inherited in a recessive manner.

>> ○ Encodes β-alanyl dopamine synthetase enzyme, promoting synthesis of β-alanyl dopamine from dopamine and β-alanine with the help of ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

⑸ Curly Wing Mutant (Cy, curly)

<br>

> ① Discovered by Ward in 1923 through natural occurrence.

> ② Located on the second chromosome: It is located at the 22F4-23B2 position of the polytene chromosome.

> ③ Inherited in a dominant manner.

> ④ Homozygous mutants die during late embryo or early larval stages.

⑹ Apterous Mutant (ap, apterous)

**Figure 7.** Sketch of Calvin B. Bridge's Salivary Gland Chromosomes

<br>

⑴ Salivary gland chromosomes are clustered together in chromocenters.

⑵ This clustering facilitates the production of glue required for pupation.

⑶ Salivary gland chromosomes have a polytene structure with 1024 strands.

⑷ Salivary glands undergo degeneration during metamorphosis.
