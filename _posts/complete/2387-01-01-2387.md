## **1. RS Determination Method**

⑴ RS nomenclature is absolute position nomenclature.

> ① Absolute configuration

> ② Relative configuration **:** Experimental relationship indicating whether they are the same in position even if the absolute configuration is not known.

⑵ Basic principles

> ① Priority rules are the same as for EZ isomers.

> ② With the 4<sup>th</sup> atom placed behind, if the direction in which atoms 1, 2, 3 rotate is clockwise, it is R; counterclockwise, it is S.

> ③ R isomer **:** Derived from 'rectus,' meaning clockwise

> ④ S isomer **:** Derived from 'sinister,' meaning counterclockwise

## **2. Author's Proposed Principle** 

⑴ **Formula 1:** If "1<sup>st</sup> vector × 4<sup>th</sup> vector = 2<sup>nd</sup> vector," then S

**Figure. 1.** RS determination method using **Formula 1**

If the cross product direction is 3<sup>rd</sup> vector, it is R.

<br>

⑵ **Formula 2:** If "1<sup>st</sup> vector × 2<sup>nd</sup> vector = 3<sup>rd</sup> vector," then S

⑶ **Formula 3:** If "3<sup>rd</sup> vector × 4<sup>th</sup> vector = 1<sup>st</sup> vector," then S **:** Often, methyl is 3<sup>rd</sup>, and hydrogen is 4<sup>th</sup>.

⑷ Explanation of **Formula 1:** If the cross product direction of the position vectors of atoms 1 and 4, with the central carbon as the origin, is 2<sup>nd</sup> vector, the absolute configuration is S.

⑸ Memorize it as S because it's special.

⑹ Note that the cross product does not perfectly match the tetrahedral orientation, as it outputs a vector orthogonal to the operand vectors.

## **3. Proof of Author's Proposed Principle**

**Figure. 2.** Situation of proving the author's proposed principle

<br>

⑴ Let's prove **Formula 2.**

⑵ It represents a chiral center of sp3 tetrahedral orientation with the center (blue circle) **:** The surrounding 4 atoms are A, B, C, O (black circles)

⑶ **Assumption** **:** A is given as 1<sup>st</sup> priority and B as 2<sup>nd</sup> priority according to [CIP priorities](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1358#2-e-z-nomenclature)

⑷ 1<sup>st</sup> vector = Position vector of A - Position vector of the center = (0.5, -0.5, -0.5)

⑸ 2<sup>nd</sup> vector = Position vector of B - Position vector of the center = (-0.5, 0.5, -0.5)

⑹ 3<sup>rd</sup> vector = Position vector of O - Position vector of the center = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)

⑺ According to RS determination method, if A and B are 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> priority, and O is 3<sup>rd</sup> priority while C is 4<sup>th</sup> priority, it is S configuration; if C is 3<sup>rd</sup> priority and O is 4<sup>th</sup> priority, it is R configuration.

⑻ 1<sup>st</sup> vector × 2<sup>nd</sup> vector = (0.5, 0.5, 0) (Note: '×' denotes cross product)

<br>

⑼ Since the direction of 1<sup>st</sup> vector × 2<sup>nd</sup> vector and 3<sup>rd</sup> vector is similar, if O is 3<sup>rd</sup> priority, it is S configuration → **Formula 2** holds.

⑽ The actual angle between 1<sup>st</sup> vector × 2<sup>nd</sup> vector and 3<sup>rd</sup> vector is only 35.26439°

> **v1** = (0.5, 0.5, 0), **v2** = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)

> ⇔ **v1 ∙** **v2** = 0.5 = <span>|</span>**v1**<span>|</span> <span>|</span>**v2**<span>|</span> cos θ = 0.25 √6

> ⇔ θ = arccos (0.5 / 0.25√6) = 0.6154797 rad = 35.26439°
