## **1. Overview**

⑴ Model Organisms for Developmental Research

## **2. Genetic Identity**

⑴ Basis of Genetic Identity

> ① Totipotency in plants

> ② Nuclear transfer in animals

>> ○ Briggs & King's experiment: Concluded changes in nuclear activity occur after significant development

>> ○ Gurdon's experiment: Induced development even with differentiated cell nuclei

> ③ Reproductive cloning in mammals

> ④ Differentiation potential of stem cells

>> ○ Stem cell: Ability to differentiate into specific cell types

>> ○ **Unipotency:** Ability to differentiate into only one type of cell

>> ○ **Multipotency:** Ability to differentiate into several types of cells

>> ○ **Pluripotency:** Ability to differentiate into all cell types

>> ○ **Totipotency:** Ability to develop into a complete organism, including extraembryonic structures

 ⑵ Types of Stem Cells

> ① **Type 1:** Embryonic Cells

>> ○ Definition: Blastomeres themselves

>> ○ Trophoblast cells + Inner cell mass. **Totipotency**

> ② **Type 2:** Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC)

>> ○ Definition: Cells obtained during embryo differentiation

>> ○ **Advantages:** **Pluripotency**

>> ○ **Disadvantages:** Ethical issues (considered up to blastocyst stage, but still ethical concerns)

>> ○ Types: Oocyte-derived ESC, Parthenogenetic ESC, Virgin-born ESC, Somatic cell nuclear transfer ESC

>> ○ Oocyte-derived ESC: Inner cell mass taken from the blastocyst

>> ○ Virgin-born ESC: Eggs develop without sperm. Dr. Hwang Woo-suk's research

>> ○ History

>>> ○ Established in 1981 from mouse blastocysts

>>> ○ In 1998, Thomson et al. established human embryonic stem cells (hESC) for the first time

> ③ **Type 3:** Adult Stem Cells (ASC)

>> ○ Definition: Stem cells found in adults

>>> ○ Note: The environment around adult stem cells is referred to as the niche

>> ○ **Advantages:** No ethical concerns

>> ○ **Disadvantages:** **Multipotency**, **Unipotency**

>> ○ Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC)

>>> ○ Differentiates into white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, etc.

>>> ○ Associated with malignant blood disorders, severe aplastic anemia, etc.

>>> ○ CD34+

>> ○ Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC)

>>> ○ Derived from mesoderm, forms bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels, fat, etc.

>>> ○ Differentiates into skin, muscle tissue, and even nerve tissue

>>> ○ Related to joint cartilage damage, bio-material production, and nervous system disorders

>>> ○ CD73+, CD90+, CD105+

>> ○ Bone Marrow Stem Cells

>>> ○ Composed of hematopoietic stem cells: Differentiates into white blood cells, red blood cells, macrophages

>>> ○ Procedure takes 30 minutes

>>> ○ Normal daily activities possible immediately after the procedure

>> ○ Neural Stem Cells

>>> ○ Also present in the adult nervous system

>> ○ Skin Stem Cells

>> ○ Cord Blood Stem Cells (CBC)

>>> ○ Derived from fetuses with undeveloped immune systems. Extracted from placenta and umbilical cord blood

>>> ○ **No immune rejection**

>>> ○ Active

>>> ○ Assists in regenerating damaged cartilage tissue

>>> ○ **Type 1:** Hematopoietic Stem Cells

>>> ○ **Type 2:** Mesenchymal Stem Cells

>>> ○ Low-grade GVHD

>> ○ Umbilical Cord Stem Cells

>>> ○ **No immune rejection**

>> ○ **Type 4:** Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC)

> ⑤ **Type 5:** Terminally Differentiated Cells

⑶ Determination: Point of Cellular Differentiation Through Gene Expression (e.g., MyoD1 Expression)

> ① Autonomous Determination: Determination from the beginning (e.g., protostomes, deuterostomes)

>> ○ Example: Concentration distribution of cytoplasmic determinants in the egg becomes uneven after fertilization

> ② Conditional Determination: Determination influenced by surrounding cytoplasmic factors during development

>> ○ Cell differentiation can be induced by signaling molecules from neighboring cells

## **3. Developmental Process**

⑴ Overview

> ① Step 1: Cell Division

> ② Step 2: Cell Differentiation

> ③ Step 3: Morphogenesis

> ④ Step 4: Pattern Formation

⑵ **Activation of Ovum**

> ① Early Ovum Activation: Before fertilization

>> ○ Uses NADPH to form the vitelline membrane, activating NAD+

>> ○ Inactivates MAPK → Pauses cell division → Prepares for proper fertilization, initiates DNA replication

> ② Late Ovum Activation: After fertilization

>> ○ Insufficient time for direct transcription → Transfers mRNA to the cytoplasm → Produces proteins required for fertilization → Immediate transcriptional inhibition effect is absent

>> ○ Transcription occurs after the blastula stage, so transcriptional inhibitors take effect at this stage

>> ○ Protein production occurs at higher pH levels, so Na+/H+ exchange pump → pH increase

⑶ **Blastula**

> ① Blastula has a blastocoel

> ② Blastocoel degenerates and disappears soon after

⑸ **Gastrulation**: Formation of the Embryonic Germ Layers

> ① Gastrulation: Ingression

>> ○ Morphogen: A substance that, as it diffuses, creates concentration gradients, determining cell fate based on exposure level to the gradient

> ② Germ Layers

>> ○ Neural tube induction

>> ○ Surface ectodermal cells: Ectoderm

>> ○ Archenteron dorsal lip (dorsal lip of the blastopore): Mesoderm, endoderm

>> ○ (Note) Neural crest: Ectoderm

>> ○ (Note) Neural crest: Mesoderm

>> ○ (Note) Neural crest: Ectoderm

>> ○ Endodermal cells: Endoderm

> ③ Formation of the Germ Layers Mechanism

>> ○ Extensive cell movement

>> ○ Archenteron: Degenerates and disappears. Replaced by the endoderm

>> ○ Formation of embryonic layers

**Figure. 1.** Formation of the Germ Layers

<br>

> ① Ectoderm **:** Epidermis, nervous system, brain, pigment cells, lens of the eye, **adrenal medulla**

> ② Mesoderm **:** Muscles, nephric duct, somite, heart, connective tissue, kidney (metanephros), circulatory system, bones and skeletal muscles, **adrenal cortex**, dermis

> ③ Endoderm **:** Respiratory system, digestive system, endocrine glands, bladder

>> ○ Note: The liver, lungs, intestines, etc., are all endodermal, but only the kidney is mesodermal

> ④ Germ cells: Sperm and egg cells. Not part of the germ layers
