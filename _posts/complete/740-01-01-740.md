## **1\. Reflection of Waves**

 ⑴ Fixed End Reflection

> ① When a wave is reflected from a denser medium to a rarer medium

> ② Phase of the wave changes by π

 ⑵ Free End Reflection

> ① When a wave is reflected from a rarer medium to a denser medium

> ② Phase of the wave remains unchanged

## **2\. Refraction of Waves**

 ⑴ Refraction of Surface Waves

> ① Thought Experiment: If we consider a wave as a line segment with width, where one end is faster and the other end is slower, the slower end bends towards the slower side.

> ② Conclusion: Waves refract towards the slower side.

 ⑵ [Refraction of Light](https://jb243.github.io/pages/746)

> ① Light has thickness, and considering reinforcement interference, the above thought experiment is valid.

> ② Conclusion: Regardless of elastic waves or particle waves, waves refract towards the slower side.

  ⑶ **Example 1:** Waves Approaching a Coastline

> ① Waves progressing towards concave portions of the coastline move faster due to the greater depth of water compared to the protruding parts.

> ② Consequently, as waves approach the coastline, their crests become more parallel to the shore.

  ⑷ **Example 2:** Refraction of Day and Night Sounds

> ① The speed of sound increases with higher air temperatures.

> ② During the day, sound waves bend upwards, while during the night, they bend downwards.

  ⑸ **Example 3:** Speed of Sound in Seawater

**Figure 1.** Deep-sea Sound Velocity Profile

> ① **Case 1:** Depth ＜ 1,000 m: Sound refracts downward.

> ② **Case 2:** Depth ＞ 1,000 m: Sound refracts upward.

> ③ Sound Channel: Exists around 1,000 m.

>> ○ Sound propagates directionally in the direction parallel to the sea surface at around 1,000 m, creating a sound channel.

>> ○ Utilized by whales and submarines.

  ⑹ **Example 4:** Light Refraction by Water - Objects appear shallower than their actual depth in water.

  ⑺ **Example 5:** Light Refraction by Lenses

  ⑻ **Example 6:** Light Refraction by the Atmosphere

> ① Mirage

>> ○ The speed of light decreases with higher air temperatures.

>> ○ Cold air above and hot air below: Light from the sky is bent downward when passing through hot air layers.

>> ○ Cold air below and hot air above: Light traveling upward is bent downward, creating the illusion of floating objects.

> ② Phenomenon of the Sun being visible below the horizon during sunrise and sunset.

> ③ Phenomenon of the Sun appearing elliptical: The Sun near the horizon appears elliptical.

> ④ Mirage

> ⑤ Twinkling stars

## **3\. Principle of Superposition**

 ⑴ Principle of Superposition

> ① **Principle 1:** F(x + y) = F(x) + F(y)

> ② **Principle 2:** F(ax) = aF(x)

> ③ Examples of F: ax, d/dx, ∫ dx

 ⑵ Superposition of Wave Phenomena

> ① Wave Equation

> ② Superposition of Waves: If φ1 and φ2 are solutions to the wave equation, then φ = aφ1 + bφ2 is also a solution.

## **4\. Interference**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Phenomenon reflecting the principle of superposition.

> ② **Type 1:** Constructive Interference: When two waves with different phases overlap in a way that their amplitudes add up.

> ③ **Type 2:** Destructive Interference: When two waves with different phases overlap in a way that their amplitudes cancel out.

 ⑵ Mathematical Representation

> ① Euler's Representation

>> ○ A: Amplitude

>> ○ eiφ: Phase

> ② Superposition of Waves

> ③ Interference of Waves

>> ○ Interference generally refers to a situation where A1 ≃ A2 = A.

>> ○ Wave function Ψ

>>> ○ Amplitude: 2A cos((φ1 - φ2) ÷ 2)

>>> ○ Phase term: exp(i(φ1 + φ2) ÷ 2)

>>> ○ Interference term: cos((φ1 - φ2) ÷ 2)

>> ○ 0 ≤ |ψ| ≤ 2A

>>> ○ Constructive Interference: Δx = nλ

>>> ○ Destructive Interference: Δx = (n + ½) λ

## **5\. Standing Waves**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Two continuous waves with different velocities along a straight line appear stationary.

> ② Nodes: Points of no vibration in a standing wave.

> ③ Antinodes: Points of maximum amplitude in a standing wave.

 ⑵ Mathematical Representation

  ⑶ **Case 1:** Closed-End Standing Waves

> ① Nodes form at both tied ends.

> ② Depending on the mode n, the wavelength of standing waves formed in the string of length ℓ is 2ℓ / n.

> ③ Pythagorean Scale: Pythagoras used irrational numbers to create the scale.

>> ○ **Principle 1:** Perfect Fifth Relation: Sol is 2/3 the length of Do.

>> ○ **Principle 2:** Octave: A higher Do is 1/2 the length of the lower Do.

>> ○ These principles can be used to create the entire scale.

>> ○ These irrational numbers are sometimes approximated as fractions.

  ⑷ **Case 2:** Open-End Standing Waves

> ① Antinodes form at the ends of an open pipe.

> ② Depending on the mode n, the wavelength of standing waves formed in a pipe of length ℓ is 2ℓ / n.

  ⑸ **Case 3:** Closed-End Standing Waves

> ① In a closed pipe with one end closed and one end open, the closed end forms a node and the open end forms an antinode.

> ② Depending on the mode n, the wavelength of standing waves formed in a pipe of length ℓ is 4ℓ / (2n - 1).

## **6\. Doppler Effect**

 ⑴ Formulation

> ① vs: Speed of the source (e.g., sound source)

> ② vd: Speed of the detector

> ③ v0: Speed of the wave (e.g., sound wave)

> ④ f0: Frequency of the wave

> ⑤ f: Observed frequency

> ⑥ (Note) Use intuition to determine the signs.

 ⑵ Moving Source: Measured wavelength changes, measured speed is constant.

 ⑶ Moving Detector: Measured wavelength remains constant, measured speed changes.
