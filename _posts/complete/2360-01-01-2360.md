## **Overview**

⑴ The winning formula for the interview is to anticipate all questions and prepare special answers.

⑵ It is necessary to research the other party as much as possible and find common points.

⑶ Deep questions related to the Cover Letter have also been arranged in the anticipated questions below.

⑷ ChatGPT 4.0 may even create an expected interview problems.

<br>

<br>

## **Question 1.** Self-Introduction

⑴ **1-1.** 1-minute self-introduction

> ① Completed Bachelor's and Master's at Seoul National University, continuing studies in spatial biology and bioengineering.

> ② Currently researching the spatial transcriptome while working as a researcher at Portray Inc. 

⑵ **1-2.** How have you been recently?

> ① I have prepared a sci-fi novel as the first work after establishing a publishing company.

> ② The project started with a belief that I, as a single person, can solve many problems by sharing creative ideas to the public.

> ③ The problem I have in the novel is basically the garbage in the Pacific ocean, and I suggest an idea of discovery of novel microogranicsms that can decompose garbage in the ocean by utilizing super-resolution molecular imaging tools.

## **Question 2.** Motivation for Application

⑴ **2-1.** Why spatial biology?

> ① There are the following advantages when studying spatial biology

> ② **Advantage 1.** Easy detection of biomarkers

> ③ **Advantage 2.** We can study cell-to-cell interactions that are spatially close.

> ④ **Advantage 3.** We can increase the reliability of analysis using spatial statistics.

> ⑤ **Advantage 4.** We can study multicellularity → Connects with theoretical biology.

⑵ **2-2.** Why **organoids**? 

> ① **Advantage 1.** It can promote independence in research: it can reduce dependence on hospitals or doctors

> ② **Advantage 2.** Many pharmaceutical fields are looking to use organoids instead of animal testing: President Biden of the United States has signed related legislation

> ③ **Advantage 3.** Organoids are very similar to real organs, so they can perform invasive analyses that cannot be done in real organs

⑶ **2-3.** Why **systems biology**?

> ① Systems biology is a field where computational algorithms, principles of physics, tools of chemistry, and biological intuition come together.

> ② Only through this interdisciplinary field can we unravel the mysteries of heterogeneity, robustness, multicellularity, and emergence that are unique in biological systems.

⑷ **2-4.** What kinds of cancers have you studied?

> ① While working at my current company, I have researched a significant number of cancer types, including lung cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, blood cancer, and thyroid cancer, through meetings with various clients.

⑸ **2-5.** Why Switzerland? Why Zurich?

> ① Because a systematic approach to studying biological heterogeneity is particularly strong in Zurich.

⑹ **2-6.** Why pursue a PhD degree?

> ① To clarify the theory that explains biological heterogeneity.

> ② I believe this will pave the way to innovate medicine and provide insights into solving many global issues, including environmental problems.

<br>

<br>

## **Question 3.** Current Status

⑴ **3-1.** Have you recently read a paper of particular interest?

> ① In the paper titled "[Spatial mapping of the total transcriptome by in situ polyadenylation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01517-6)." it was clarified that protozoa and non-mRNA can also be read through Visium when they undergo adenylation. I would like to incorporate this finding into metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to create a field in environmental bioinformatics.

⑵ **3-2.** My strengths and weaknesses

> ① I llike to work. I do it for funs, I do it for games, but I don't do it by another man's will. That's my strength.

> ② Actually, I don't have many weaknesses. But if I need to tell you only one weakness, I am too serious about work. 

⑶ **3-3.** If you have hardships in your research, how can you overcome them? 

> ① Currently, I have such hardships in a paper that continuously has been rejected by several journals.

> ② But, the clearest success strategy I have is "the more, the better". If I invest more time on it, I can make more insights and evidence, which will result in the completion of the paper. 

<br>

<br>

## **Question 4.** Career Plan

⑴ **4-1.** What do you want to do in your Ph.D.

> ① Spatio-temporal transcriptomics.

> ② A theoretical study on biological heterogeneity.

⑵ **4-2.** What will you do after graduation? 

> ① I want to develop a spatio-temporal transcriptomics to understand cellular behaviors.

> ② I want write a book about special insights by completing theoretical works on biological heterogeneity. Introduction of information theory and game theory needed.

<br>

<br>

## **Question 5.** Additional Questions

⑴ **5-1.** Any additional questions? 

> ① I am personally very interested in **interactions between the microbiome and the host**. It's said that there is much research on such interactions in the brain, and I wonder if such research is also being done in brain organoids
