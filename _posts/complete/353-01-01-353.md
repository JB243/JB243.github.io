## **1\. Composition of the Ocean**

 ⑴ Components of the Hydrosphere

> ① Natural Water = Seawater (97.22%) + Freshwater (2.78%)

> ② Components of Freshwater

>> ○ Freshwater = Glacial Ice and Permafrost (1.91%) + Groundwater (0.84%) + Others (0.03%)

>> ○ Rainwater dissolves minerals on land, leading to high concentrations of CO32- and Ca2+

> ③ Components of Seawater

>> ○ Composition of Salts

>>> ○ Average salinity of seawater is 35 ‰: 35 grams of salts dissolved in 1 kg of seawater

>>> ○ Origin 1: Weathering and erosion of rocks

>>> ○ Origin 2: Submarine volcanoes: Explosions of submarine volcanoes contribute to high Cl- concentration

 ⑵ Oceanic Structure **:** Differentiated by changes in temperature with depth

**Figure 1.** Division of Oceanic Layers 

> ① Mixed Layer (50 m ~ 200 m, 2%): Vertical temperature remains constant

>> ○ Solar energy influence ○, Wind influence ○: Temperature is uniform due to wind-induced mixing

>> ○ Thicker mixed layer during **winter**: Cooling of surface water due to density-driven circulation increases its thickness

>> ○ Thickest mixed layer at **mid-latitudes**: Strong winds at mid-latitudes (due to atmospheric circulation)

> ② Thermocline (200 m ~ 1,000 m, 18%): Rapid decrease in temperature with increasing depth

>> ○ Solar energy influence O, Wind influence X

>> ○ Stability: Lower layer is colder than upper layer. Restricts convective mixing

>> ○ Sea surface slope is opposite to thermocline slope

**Figure 2.** Sea Surface Slope and Thermocline Slope 

> ③ Abyssal Layer (1,000 m ~, 80%): Formed by polar waters, deep-sea formation

>> ○ Solar energy influence X, Wind influence X

>> ○ Constant temperature regardless of latitude or season: -1 to 3 ℃, average 3.9 ℃

>> ○ Very low temperature, high density, low salinity

>> ○ Maximal density temperature of water decreases with increasing pressure: Explains temperature decrease with depth in abyssal layer

> ① **Background Knowledge:** Waves are refracted towards the slower side.

>> ○ **Incident Experiment:** When thinking of waves as lines with width, if one end is faster and the opposite end is slower, the wave bends towards the slower side.

>> ○ Elastic waves, regardless of particle waves, are refracted towards the slower side.

> ② **Case 1:** Depth ＜ 1,000 m **:** Sound is refracted downward.

> ③ **Case 2:** Depth ＞ 1,000 m **:** Sound is refracted upward.

> ④ **Sound Channel:** Sound channel exists around 1,000 m before and after.

>> ○ Sound travels in a wave pattern around 1,000 m before and after and propagates parallel to the sea surface.

## **3\. **Movement of Seawater**

⑴ **Speed of Waves**

**Figure. 5.** Deep Sea Waves and Shallow Sea Waves

> ① **Motion direction of water particles on a ship:** Direction of wave propagation

> ② **Wave speed general equation**

>> ○ **Meaning 1:** Speed increases with depth (obvious)

>> ○ **Meaning 2:** Longer wavelength results in higher speed **:** Easy to understand when imagining a tsunami

> ③ **Case 1:** **Deep Sea Waves** **:** When depth ＞ 0.5 λ. Also known as surface waves.

>> ○ Water particles form **circular orbits**.

>> ○ The radius decreases with increasing depth.

>> ○ Speed of deep-sea waves **:** (Note) It does not mean that the speed of waves infinitely increases with depth.

>> ○ As depth increases, the size of circular motion of water particles decreases.

> ④ **Case 2:** **Shallow Water Waves** **:** When depth ＜ 0.05 λ. Also known as long waves.

>> ○ As depth increases, only wavelength shortens.

>> ○ Speed of shallow water waves

>> ○ As depth decreases, **:** propagation speed decreases, wavelength shortens, wave height increases.

> ⑤ **Case 3:** 0.05 λ ＜ depth ＜ 0.5 λ **:** Waves start to be influenced by the seabed.

> ⑥ **Tidal Waves (Tsunamis)**

>> ○ **Type 1:** Storm Tsunamis **:** Generated by low pressure (typhoon)

>>> ○ Reaches coast → Depth decreases → Speed decreases → Wavelength decreases → Wave height increases

>> ○ **Type 2:** Seismic Tsunamis (Tsunamis) **:** Generated by vertical movements like earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides

>>> ○ Has very long wavelengths and shares characteristics with **shallow water waves**

>>> ○ Seismic tsunamis occur better with vertical stratification rather than horizontal stratification

>> ○ Density-driven currents: Currents caused by differences in density

>> ○ Geostrophic currents: Also known as topographic currents

>>> ○ Equilibrium between pressure gradient and Coriolis force in currents: Similar to the principle of geostrophic winds in the atmosphere

>>> ○ High-pressure areas are positioned to the right of current direction, flowing parallel to isobars

>> ○ Counter currents: Currents that fill empty spaces left by other currents' movement

> ③ **Warm and Cold Currents**

>> ○ Warm currents: Flow from higher to lower latitudes. Examples: California Current, etc.

>> ○ Cold currents: Flow from lower to higher latitudes. Examples: Gulf Stream, Kuroshio Current, etc.

>> ○ Convergence zones: Points where warm and cold currents meet. Various marine species can be found here

> ④ **Coriolis Effect and Ocean Currents**

**Figure. 6.** Ekman Transport

>> ○ Ekman depth: Depth at which seawater flows in the opposite direction of the wind. Also known as the Ekman layer or friction layer

>> ○ Northern hemisphere currents flow clockwise, while southern hemisphere currents flow counterclockwise due to the Coriolis effect

>> ○ In the northern hemisphere, the average flow of water in the Ekman layer is perpendicular to the wind direction towards the right

>> ○ The direction of surface water movement is 45° to the right of the wind direction

>> ○ **Tip:** Topographic currents are formed in the direction of the wind and often accompany Ekman transport

> ⑤ **Major Global Ocean Currents**

>> ○ Others: Liman Current, Tsushima Warm Current

> ⑦ **Thermohaline Circulation 1:** Horizontal Circulation of Seawater

>> ○ Tropical circulation: Circulation flowing from 0° to 60°. Wind → Ekman transport → Sea surface slope → Topographic currents

>>> ○ Tropical circulation transports the most heat energy

>>> ○ Trade winds and westerlies cause sea surface elevation at latitude 30°

>>> ○ Types of topographic currents: North Equatorial Current, South Equatorial Current, North Pacific Current (North Atlantic Current), East/West Boundary Currents

>>> ○ Northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere currents appear symmetrically (e.g., North Equatorial Current and South Equatorial Current)

>>> ○ South Pacific Current combines with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current

>>> ○ Comparison of East/West Boundary Currents

**Table. 4.** Comparison of East/West Boundary Currents

>>> ○ Strengthening of Westward Currents: As the prevailing force increases towards higher latitudes, the sea surface slope in the Western Pacific becomes larger than in the Eastern Pacific

>> ○ Equatorial Countercurrent

>>> ○ A current flowing from west to east along the equator due to

 the difference in sea surface elevation caused by North Equatorial Current and South Equatorial Current

>>> ○ A type of topographic current

> ⑧ **Thermohaline Circulation 2:** Vertical Circulation of Seawater

>> ○ **Type 1:** Intermediate Current

>> ○ **Type 2:** Deep Sea Current

>>> ○ Surrounding seawater becomes saltier due to freezing, increasing its density

>>> ○ Saltier water sinks, forming deep-sea water

>>> ○ Such deep-sea water is generated in high-latitude areas

>>> ○ The circulation of deep-sea water is slower than that of surface water due to negligible influence of wind, etc.

>>> ○ Stronger circulation of deep-sea water results in stronger surface currents and smaller temperature differences between high and low latitudes (**∵** energy transport)

>> ○ **Type 3:** Bottom Current

>>> ○ (Note) Equatorial Undercurrent

> ⑨ Deep-sea circulation and surface circulation are interconnected, forming significant circulation in the ocean
