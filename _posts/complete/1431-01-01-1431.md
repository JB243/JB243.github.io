## **1. Type 1.** Identifying gene function

⑴ Perturb-seq

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Treat Cas9-expressing cells with various types of gRNA libraries

>> ○ Using CRISPR-Cas9, various perturbations occur in each cell depending on the type of gRNA

>> ○ At least 2.5 million cells should remain after filtering

>> ○ There should be an average of at least 100 cells per perturbation

>> ○ Each cell should have approximately 10,000 UMIs

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Use sequencing technologies that detect both gRNA and mRNA (e.g., scRNA-seq, [MERFISH](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.30.569494v1.full))

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Group cells by gRNA expression: Naturally groups cells by perturbation conditions

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Identify gene function

>> ○ Premise: Genes with similar functions are likely to exhibit similar expression patterns

>> ○ **Discoverable Result 1.** Changes in gene expression due to perturbations

>> ○ **Discoverable Result 2.** Differences in perturbation effects due to genetic variants

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Various perturbations occur in vivo in each Cas9-expressing cell due to gRNA via the CRISPR-Cas9 system

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Perform scRNA-seq and MERFISH after approximately 10 days

## **2. Type 2.** Identifying transcription regulation

⑴ BS-seq (bisulfite sequencing)

> ① Treat with bisulfite to determine methylation patterns

> ② Enables epigenomic profiling

⑵ **ChIP-seq** (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing)

> ① **Definition:** Enables analysis of DNA regions bound to specific proteins, such as transcription factors.

> ② Combines DNA sequencing with ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) to identify binding sites of DNA-associated proteins.

> ③ 1<sup>st</sup>. Treat with a cross-linking agent (e.g., formaldehyde) to fix proteins (e.g., transcription factors) to DNA.

> ④ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Lyse the cells, leaving only the DNA/protein complexes.

> ⑤ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Use sonication to break DNA into small fragments; cross-linked DNA remains intact.

> ⑥ 4<sup>th</sup>. Add antibodies attached to magnetic beads; applying a magnetic field allows isolation of specific proteins and their associated DNA.

> ⑦ 5<sup>th</sup>. Reverse cross-linking: Apply heat to the precipitate to separate DNA from proteins.

> ⑧ 6<sup>th</sup>. Perform sequencing to determine the DNA sequence.

> ⑨ 7<sup>th</sup>. Compare the sequencing results to the genome reference to identify binding sites of transcription factors and other proteins.

 ⑶ **Hi-C seq** (high throughput chromatin conformation capture sequencing)

> ① Definition: Investigates sequences that are naturally close together on chromosomes

> ② Examines DNA distances to reveal the 3D folding structure of chromosomes within the nucleus
