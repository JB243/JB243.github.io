>> ○ Understanding

>>> ○ In other words, entropy is defined as the average value of uncertainty

>>> ○ Similar to entropy in physics, higher values are obtained as disorder increases: higher entropy means higher heterogeneity

>>> ○ It applies the surprisal (-log p(x)) of each event to the probability weight (p(x)) of each event

>> ○ Examples

>>> ○ Fair coin toss **:** H = -0.5 log<sub>2</sub> 0.5 - 0.5 log<sub>2</sub> 0.5 = 1

>>> ○ Fair die ****: H = 6 × (-(1/6) log2 (1/6)) = log<sub>2</sub> 6 = 2.58

>>> ○ If X follows a uniform distribution, H(X) = log n holds

>> ○ **Source Coding Theorem**

>>> ○ Definition: For a very long data sequence, if the compression rate is maximized, the average number of bits of the compressed data approaches the entropy.

>>> ○ In other words, it refers to the number of bits required to represent a given set of possibilities.

>>> ○ When stored in base log2, it represents the number of bits; when stored in base logk, it indicates the required storage capacity in a k-ary system.

>>> ○ Kraft's Inequality: A constraint that ensures every entity can be represented by a unique bit sequence.

>> ○ **Feature 2.** H(X) ≥ 0

>> ○ **Feature 3.** H<sub>b</sub>(X) = (log<sub>b</sub>a) H<sub>a</sub>(X) (where a and b are under the log)

>>> ○ log<sub>b</sub>p = (log<sub>b</sub>a) log<sub>a</sub>p

>> ○ [Python code](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1892#6-data-science)

<br>

```python
import numpy as np

def shannon_index(data):
    # Count unique values and their occurrences in the data
    values, counts = np.unique(data, return_counts=True)
    # Calculate proportions using the counts
    proportions = counts / sum(counts)
    # Calculate Shannon index, considering only non-zero proportions
    return -np.sum(proportions * np.log(proportions))

# Example data, where '1' appears 3 times, '2' appears 2 times, and '3' appears 1 time
data = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]

# Calculate the Shannon index
index = shannon_index(data)
print(f"Shannon index: {index}")

<br>

>> ○ Overview

>>> ○ A measure of how two probability distributions diverge.

>>> ○ It indicates the divergence between an approximate distribution p(x), which aims to mimic the true distribution, and the true distribution q(x).

>>> ○ Typically, the true distribution is a complex probability distribution function, while the approximate distribution is represented using a parameterized model.

>>> ○ The approximate distribution can be made manageable, often resembling a simple distribution like the normal distribution.

>> ○ Mutual information

⑶ **Comparison 1.** `Gini impurity`

<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b5c89d-77b8-49c2-8e50-a9db6bb72306)

<br>

> ① Entropy is not the unique measure, alternative measures like Gini impurity are proposed.

> ② Gini impurity considers the probability of mislabeling (1 - P(x<sub>i</sub>)) weighted by the weight of each sample (P(x<sub>i</sub>)).

> ③ Both Gini impurity and entropy increase as the given data becomes more disordered: Origin of impurity.

> ④ (Conceptual Distinction) The Gini Coefficient in Economics

>> ○ The concept was first introduced to evaluate income inequality: It can assess not only income but also the degree of inequality in the distribution of a discrete variable.

>> ○ As the Gini coefficient moved from economics to the fields of machine learning and information theory, it implies similar inequality, but the mathematical definition changes.

>> ○ Difference: If the distribution of the variable is entirely uniform,

>>> ○ In economics, the Gini coefficient becomes extremely egalitarian, so it has a value of 0.

>>> ○ In information theory, the Gini coefficient attains its maximum value due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Intuitively, it becomes most disordered, thus reaching the maximum value.

⑷ **Comparison 2.** `Connectivity index (CI)`

> ① In a spatial lattice, if a specific spot and its nearest neighbor are in different clusters, the CI value increases.

> ② Therefore, a higher CI value implies higher heterogeneity.

⑸ **Comparison 3.** `Simpson index`

> ① Another measure based on information theory, along with Shannon entropy

> ② Based on spatial transcriptomics, the probability of two random spots belonging to the same cluster ([ref](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-023-01185-4#Sec2))

> ③ The lower the Simpson index, the higher the heterogeneity implied

⑹ **Comparison 4.** `Cluster modularity`

> ① Based on spatial transcriptomics, a metric indicating the purity (homogeneity) of spots within a cluster ([ref](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-023-01185-4#Sec2))

<br>

> ③ Hidden Markov model

>> ○ If χ = {X<sub>i</sub>} is a Markov process and Y<sub>i</sub> = ϕ(X<sub>i</sub>) (where ϕ is a deterministic function), then y = {Y<sub>i</sub>} is a hidden Markov model.

> ④ **Feature 1.** If <span>Pr(x<sub>n</sub> | x<sub>n-1</sub>)</span> is independent of n, the Markov process is stationary (time-invariant).

> ⑤ **Feature 2.** Aperiodic ⊂ irreducible.

> ⑥ **Feature 3.** Markov process can prove the second law of thermodynamics (law of increasing entropy).

>> ○ Assumes uniform stationary distribution.
