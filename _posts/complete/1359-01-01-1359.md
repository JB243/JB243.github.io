## **3\. Nucleophiles:** Reaction Kinetics Concepts

⑴ Comparison of Nucleophilicities of Ions with the Same Group but Different Periods: Larger period implies stronger nucleophilicity.

> ① Example: CH<sub>3</sub>O<sup>-</sup> < CH<sub>3</sub>S<sup>-</sup>

⑵ Comparison of Nucleophilicities of Neutral Nucleophiles: Larger atoms have greater polarizability, leading to stronger nucleophilicity

> ① Strong Nucleophiles: RMgX, R<sub>2</sub>CuLi, NaNH<sub>2</sub>, NaOR, KC≡CH

> ② Weak Nucleophiles: t-BuOK, NaCN, KN<sub>3</sub>, RNH<sub>2</sub>, RCOONa, NaSR, NaBR, KI

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Solvents**

⑴ Criteria for Solvents

> ① Should dissolve reactants

>> ○ Acid-base reactions should not be conducted in nonpolar solvents.

> ② Should not participate in the reaction

>> ○ Toluene solvent shouldn't be used in halogen addition reactions since it participates

>> ○ Solvent for making Grignard reagents should not be acidic: In this case, anhydrous ether is often used

> ③ Should have low boiling point: To facilitate separation by evaporation

> ④ Polar aprotic solvents needed for S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions.

> ⑤ Organic solvents with higher density than water needed in certain cases

>> ○ Organic solvents with higher density than water: CS<sub>2</sub>, CCl<sub>4</sub>, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, DMSO

>> ○ **Purpose 1.** [Separatory funnel](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1444#:~:text=%E2%91%BC-,%EB%B6%84%EB%B3%84%EA%B9%94%EB%95%8C%EA%B8%B0,-\(separatory%20funnel\)) used together

⑵ **Category 1.** Polar Protic Solvents (PPS): Solvents with hydrogen bonding

> ① Ionizing nucleophiles are less nucleophilic in these solvents

> ② Example: Water (H<sub>2</sub>O), Ethanol (EtOH), Methanol (MeOH)

> ③ S<sub>N</sub>2: Nucleophile's charge stabilized by solvent's hydrogen ion, reducing reaction rate

⑶ **Category 2.** Polar Aprotic Solvents (PAS): Solvents without hydrogen bonding

> ① Interaction between ionizing nucleophiles and solvent is weaker

> ② Example: Acetone, THF, DMSO, DMF, Acetonitrile (CH<sub>3</sub>CN), HMPA

<br>

> ② Cations often concealed, while anions exposed

>> ○ DMSO

>>> ○ Weak π bond between 3rd-period S and 2nd-period O due to d orbitals, causing O to be negative and S to be positive

>>> ○ S concealed by hydrophobic methyl groups, exposing only O's negative charge

>>> ○ Easier solvent interaction for cations than anions

>> ○ DMF

>>> ○ Anion exposed

>>> ○ Easier solvent interaction for cations than anions

> ③ S<sub>N</sub>2: Reaction rate not decreased

>> ○ Faster reaction rate than polar protic solvents

>> ○ S<sub>N</sub>2 rate comparison: Acetone < THF < DMSO < DMF < CH3CN < HMPA

⑷ **Category 3.** Aprotic Solvents: Ionizing nucleophiles are insoluble, inhibiting reaction

> ① [Ethers used in reactions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1375#2-reactions) with hydrogen halides and Claisen rearrangements, as they only perform a few reactions

> ② Examples of ethers as solvents

>> ○ Diethyl ether: Also called ether

>> ○ Tetrahydrofuran (THF)

>> ○ Tetrahydropyran (THP)

>> ○ 1,4-dioxane

## **6\. EDG, EWG**

⑴ EDG, EWG are vital in aromatic compound multisubstitution effects, foundational in organic chemistry

⑵ Substituent Groups

> ① Strong Activating Groups: -NH<sub>2</sub>, -NHR, -NR<sub>2</sub>, -OH, -O<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ Groups with lone pairs of electrons

> ② Moderately Activating Groups: -NHCOCH<sub>3</sub>, -NHCOR, -OCOCH<sub>3</sub>, -OCH<sub>3</sub>, -OR

>> ○ Groups with lone pairs of electrons and substantial electron-withdrawing effects

> ③ Weak Activating Groups: -R, -Phe

>> ○ Groups with electron-donating inductive effects

> ④ -H: Benzene

> ⑤ Weak Deactivating Groups: -X

>> ○ Halogen groups

> ⑥ Moderately Deactivating Groups: -C≡N, -SO<sub>3</sub>H, -CO<sub>2</sub>H, -CO<sub>2</sub>R, -CHO, -COR

> ⑦ Strong Deactivating Groups: -CF<sub>3</sub>, -CCl<sub>3</sub>, -NO<sub>2</sub>, -NR<sub>3</sub>

>> ○ Groups with positive charge or -CF<sub>3</sub> group

>> ○ -CF<sub>3</sub> and -NR<sub>3</sub> have weak EWG capability but strong deactivating effects

⑶ EDG (Electron Donating Group, Activating Substituents)

> ① Strong/Moderate Activating Substituents: Electron-donating resonance effect > Electron-withdrawing inductive effect

> ② Weak Activating Substituents

⑷ EWG (Electron Withdrawing Group, Deactivating Substituents)

> ① Halogen Group

>> ○ F: High electronegativity causes the electron-withdrawing inductive effect to exceed the electron-donating resonance effect → leads to deactivation

>> ○ Cl, Br, I: The difference in periods from second-period carbon reduces the effectiveness of non-bonding electron pair resonance

>> ○ Electron-withdrawing inductive effect > Electron-donating resonance effect

> ② Strong/Moderate Deactivating Substituents

⑸ Even an EDG can function as an EWG if it cannot resonate

> ① Example: In ROC<u>H</u>, RO- group acts as an EDG, decreasing hydrogen acidity

> ② Example: In ROCH<sub>2</sub>C<u>H</u>, RO- group acts as an EWG, increasing hydrogen acidity
