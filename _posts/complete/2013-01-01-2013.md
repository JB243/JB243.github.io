## **1. Overview**

⑴ Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

> ① Microeconomics **:** Deals with the optimization decisions of individual economic agents under given conditions

> ② Macroeconomics **:** Differs from microeconomics in that it deals with aggregate variables

⑵ Flow and Stock

> ① Flow **:** Measured over a period of time (e.g., demand, income, consumption, investment, etc.)

> ② Stock **:** Measured at a specific point in time (e.g., wealth, money supply)

⑶ Nominal Variables and Real Variables

> ① Nominal GDP and Real GDP (see GDP below)

> ② Real Exchange Rate

>> ○ Budget Deficit **:** When government savings (T - G) < 0

>> ○ Budget Surplus **:** When government savings (T - G) > 0

⑷ Foreign Sector

<br>

> ① C **:** Consumption

> ② I **:** Investment

> ③ G **:** Government spending

> ④ X - Q **:** Net exports, Current Account Balance

> ⑤ Imports Q have a characteristic of partially offsetting aggregate demand

> ⑥ **Tip.** Unsold goods produced by companies are considered inventory investment and included in corporate investment

<br>

> ① Sp + T + Q **:** The sum of leakages in the circular flow of national income

>> ○ Imports Q fulfill domestic demand and thus count as a leakage

> ② I + G + X **:** The sum of injections in the circular flow of national income

>> ○ Exports X increase domestic demand and thus count as an injection

> ③ Injections > Leakages **:** National income increases

> ④ Injections = Leakages **:** National income remains constant

> ⑤ Injections < Leakages **:** National income decreases

⑺ Law of Three Equivalent Aspects **:** Holds true in a closed economy

> ① National Income by Production (GDE, gross domestic expenditure) **:** The purchase amount spent by households on the goods market

> ② National Income by Distribution (GDI, gross domestic income) **:** The factor income obtained by households from the factor market

> ③ National Income by Expenditure (GDP, gross domestic product) **:** The sales revenue obtained by firms from the goods market

> ④ Law of Three Equivalent Aspects of National Income **:** Production national income = Distribution national income = Expenditure national income ( **∵** Balance of funds)

<br>

<br>

## **3. National Income Statistics**

⑴ Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

> ① **Principle of Territoriality**

>> ○ Excludes production by nationals abroad

>> ○ Includes production by foreigners domestically

> ② Production

>> ○ Underground Economy **:** Private loans, real estate speculation, smuggling, drugs, tax evasion. **Not included in GDP**

>> ○ Transfer Transactions **:** Inheritance, gifts. **Not included in GDP**

>> ○ Capital Gains **:** Stock price fluctuations, real estate price fluctuations. **Not included in GDP**

>> ○ Government Transfer Payments **:** Unemployment benefits, disaster compensation, subsidies, etc. **Not included in GDP**

>> ○ Leisure, housework, etc. **Not included in GDP**

>> ○ **Exception** **:** Imputed rent, self-consumed agricultural products, defense, and law enforcement services

>> ○ [Supplementary Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ6CZO-rysw&list=PL11iCOlE6aYIL9z-DxtiG4oS7CZj1eva7&index=3)]

>>> ○ The purchase price of new homes is included in GDP. The purchase price of second-hand homes is not included in GDP

>>> ○ In-kind income is included in GDP. Lottery winnings are not included in GDP

>>> ○ Corporate bonds and bank interest are included in GDP. Government bond interest is not included in GDP

> ③ Final Goods

>> ○ Intermediate goods are excluded to avoid double counting

> ④ Although transfer payments are not directly included in GDP, they are indirectly included through consumption

>> ○ Reason transfer payments are not included in GDP **:** They are not goods with market value and have no reciprocal obligation

>> ○ The contribution to GDP varies depending on consumer behavior

> ⑤ Nominal GDP and Real GDP

>> ○ Nominal GDP **:** Variable expressed in monetary terms

>>> ○ Expressed in the price of the comparison year

>>> ○ Disadvantage **:** Affected by inflation

>> ○ Real GDP **:** Variable expressed in terms of the quantity of goods

>>> ○ Expressed in the price of the base year

>>> ○ In the base year, nominal variables and real variables are always the same

>>> ○ Advantage **:** Not affected by inflation

>> ○ GDP Deflator

>>> ○ Value obtained by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP

>>> ○ The most comprehensive price index calculated retrospectively from GDP statistics (Paasche method)

> ⑥ Actual GDP and Potential GDP

>> ○ Actual GDP **:** The market value of all final goods actually produced by an economy

>> ○ Potential GDP **:** The market value of final goods that can be produced when all production resources in a country are **normally** employed

>> ○ Potential GDP = Full Employment Output = Natural Output

>> ○ (Note) Potential GDP is not the maximum GDP

>> ○ GDP Gap = Potential GDP - Actual GDP

>>> ○ GDP Gap > 0 **:** Unemployment exists. There is a need to increase aggregate demand

>>> ○ GDP Gap < 0 **:** The economy is overheated. There is a need to restrain aggregate demand

> ⑦ GDP Level by Country

>> ○ South Korea **:** 2,000 trillion won per year

⑵ Distribution GDP (GDI) **:** A measure of purchasing power

> ① GDI = (Wages + Interest + Rent + Profits) + Indirect Taxes + Fixed Capital Consumption

> ② A method of estimating national income by summing factor incomes, which are rewards for production factors involved in producing final goods

> ③ Nominal GDP = Nominal GDI

> ④ Real GDP < Real GDI (Improvement in terms of trade)

> ⑤ Real GDP > Real GDI (Deterioration in terms of trade)

> ⑥ (Note) Terms of trade seem to have a trend similar to capital balance

>> ○ If the exchange rate rises, the export price falls, leading to a deterioration in terms of trade

>> ○ If the import price falls, terms of trade improve

> ⑦ (Reference) Real GDP does not reflect changes in terms of trade **:** Real GDI = Real GDP + Real trade profit/loss due to changes in terms of trade

⑶ Expenditure GDP (GDE)

> ① GDE = Private Consumption Expenditure (C) + Gross Domestic Investment (I) + Government Spending (G) + Net Exports (X-M)

⑷ Gross National Product (GNP)

> ① GNP is less preferred than GDP due to foreign labor and other factors

⑸ Gross National Income (GNI)

> ① The income earned by nationals over a period of time by providing production factors both domestically and abroad

> ② An income indicator used to measure the standard of living and welfare level of citizens

> ③ Comparison with GDI

>> ○ GDI follows the principle of territoriality, while GNI follows the principle of nationality

>> ○ To calculate GNI from GDI, net factor income from abroad must be added

⑹ (Differentiation Concept) National Wealth

> ① The total wealth a country possesses **:** The sum of the physical assets and net foreign assets held by an economy

> ② Domestic financial assets are not included as they offset each other within the country, resulting in a net wealth of zero

> ③ (Reference) Comparison with National Income

>> ○ National wealth is a stock concept. National income is a flow concept

>> ○ National wealth is the source of national income generation

>> ○ National income is the source of consumption, savings, and investment, created by the combination of national wealth and labor

⑺ Other Economic Indicators

> ① Big Mac Index

>> ○ A key index for comparing the value of currencies across about 120 countries based on the price of McDonald's Big Mac

>> ○ Compiled and published quarterly by the British economic magazine The Economist

>> ○ Assumes that the real price of the Big Mac is the same everywhere due to its standardized quality, size, and ingredients worldwide

> ② Sharpe Ratio **:** An indicator that evaluates the performance of a fund using standard deviation

> ③ [Sen Index](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044)

> ④ [Atkinson Index](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044) **:** A method for measuring income inequality based on a social welfare function

> ⑤ Engel's Coefficient **:** The proportion of food expenditure in total consumption expenditure

> ⑥ [Gini Coefficient](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2044) **:** A numerical representation of the degree of income inequality and wealth disparity, ranging from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality)

> ⑦ Nifty-50 Index **:** An Indian stock market index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange

> ⑧ Buffett Indicator **:** = Market capitalization of a country / Gross Domestic Product (GDP) * 100

<br>

| **Buffett Indicator** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Buffett Indicator < 81% | Market is significantly undervalued |
| 81% < Buffett Indicator ≤ 104% | Market is moderately undervalued |
| 104% < Buffett Indicator ≤ 127% | Market is fairly valued |
| 127% < Buffett Indicator ≤ 150% | Market is moderately overvalued |
| Buffett Indicator > 150% | Market is significantly overvalued |

## **4. The Financial Flow of National Economy**

 ⑴ Financial System

 ⑵ Relationship between Households, Firms, Government, and Finance

> ① Households are the surplus sector of funds

>> ○ Because household income is greater than household consumption

>> ○ The way surplus funds are managed by households is important

> ② Firms are the deficit sector of funds

>> ○ Because real assets exceed internal funds

>> ○ The way firms finance their required funds is important

 ⑶ Financial Institutions
