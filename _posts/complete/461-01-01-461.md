### **1\. Related to Ferry Booking**

⑴ The departure ports for Ulleungdo are Gangneung, Pohang, and Donghae

⑵ Ferry tickets are booked through `The Island You Want to Visit`: For Dokdo, only SeaStar ferries are available, but Sunrise ferries can also be used from other websites

⑶ Round trip to Ulleungdo must be paid twice: 88,000 KRW each time with the Korea Shipping Association

⑷ Dokdo only has direct trips, and after arriving, you can only look around for about 30-40 minutes before returning: 60,000 KRW for one payment with the Korea Shipping Association

⑸ If the ferry can't sail suddenly due to weather conditions, the ticket will be fully refunded

⑹ Dokdo cruising is usually allotted 4 hours

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Related to Accommodation**

⑴ There are quite a lot of hotels within Ulleungdo

⑵ Realistically, there are ferries from the mainland to Ulleungdo in the afternoon, so by the time you reach Ulleungdo → Dokdo → Ulleungdo, it's already evening and you must stay overnight in Ulleungdo

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Precautions**

⑴ Ferries to Dokdo do not always operate, so it's not always possible to go

> ① Jokingly, they say you need to accumulate three generations of good deeds to go?

> ② Travel to Dokdo has a high failure rate; there are acquaintances who failed both times they tried

⑵ Always keep your [Dokdo ferry ticket](https://m.blog.naver.com/mliysarang/223247990882) ready when in Ulleungdo

⑶ Public holiday ferry reservations fill up surprisingly fast

⑷ Seasickness can be severe, so it's necessary to prepare seasickness medicine (about 1000 KRW) in advance

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Miscellaneous**

⑴ The resident of Dokdo is determined by lottery, and if that person cannot continue living there, a new lottery is drawn
