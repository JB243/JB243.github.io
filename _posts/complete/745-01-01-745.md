## **1\. Fermat's Principle**

 ⑴ Fermat's Law (Fermat's principle)

> ① The law that light travels along the path that takes the least time

> ② Theory that encompasses the laws of reflection and refraction

> ③ To understand its profound significance, the concept of quantum optics is required

 ⑵ Law of Reflection

> ① Terminology

>> ○ Normal **:** A line perpendicular to the interface when light reflects at the boundary

>> ○ Incident **:** Light approaching the boundary

>> ○ Reflection **:** Light bouncing back from the boundary

> ② **Law 1.** The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

> ③ **Law 2.** The incident ray and the reflected ray lie in the same plane.

 ⑶ Snell's Law

> ① Definition of refractive index n

>> ○ c **:** Speed of light in a vacuum

>> ○ v **:** Speed of light in a medium

> ② **Law 1.**

> ③ **Law 2.** The incident ray and the refracted ray lie in the same plane.

 ⑷ Total Internal Reflection

> ④ Optical Fiber

**Figure. 3.** Structure of Optical Fiber

>> ○ Definition **:** A bundle of glass, fused silica, or plastic that can transmit light over hundreds of meters or more

>> ○ Diameter ranges from 0.05 μm to 0.6 cm

>> ○ Structure **:** Core, Cladding

>> ○ The material used for the core has a higher refractive index than that used for the cladding

>> ○ Practical applications

>>> ○ Multiple layers of optical fiber are used in practice: Optical fiber is too thin for geometric optics approximation (i.e., Snell's law) to apply.

>>> ○ Overlapping light of various frequencies is used for information transmission: Unlike electrons where Pauli's exclusion principle applies, light can overlap.

>>> ○ Bending of the fiber causes irregular reflections, leading to blurred images → To prevent this, graded index is used.

>>> ○ ~0.2 dB/km loss

>> ○ Classification based on material

>>> ○ Glass or plastic: Visible light, near-infrared range

>>> ○ Fused silica: Ultraviolet range to near-infrared range

>> ○ Classification based on usage

>>> ○ Reflecting probes

>>> ○ Transmissive probes

>>> ○ Dip probes

 ⑸ Negative Refraction Index

> ① Classification of materials

>> ○ **Type 1:** ε > 0, μ > 0: Normal optical materials, right-handed propagating wave

>> ○ **Type 2:** ε < 0, μ > 0: Electromagnetic plasma, decaying electromagnetic waves, many metals (UV - optical), thin wire structures (GHz)

>> ○ **Type 3:** ε > 0, μ < 0: Magnetic plasma, decaying electromagnetic waves, structured materials, natural magnetism (~GHz)

>> ○ **Type 4:** ε < 0, μ < 0: Negative refraction index, left-handed propagating wave, artificial metamaterial

 ⑹ Dispersion

> ① Prism Experiment

**Figure. 1.** Prism Experiment

> ② **Explanation 1.**

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The frequency of light remains constant even when the medium changes.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The speed of light increases as wavelength in the medium increases. As speed of light increases, refractive index decreases.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Longer wavelengths (shorter frequencies) result in less bending of light.

> ③ **Explanation 2.**

>> ○ Short wavelengths correspond to shorter time spent within atoms.

>> ○ Short wavelengths result in more collisions and resonance absorption.

> ④ Complexity of wavelengths due to various reasons

>> ○ Interaction of atoms results in a variety of resonant wavelength ranges.

>> ○ Motion of atoms also alters the resonant wavelength ranges.

>> ○ To observe specific resonant wavelength ranges, cooled atoms need to be observed.

> ⑤ Application: Rainbow

>> ○ Refraction → Internal reflection → Refraction lead to dispersion of colors

>> ○ Longer wavelengths (closer to red) result in less bending.

## **2\. Image**

 ⑴ **Type 1.** Plane Mirror

> ① Constructed so that the mirror surface is the perpendicular bisector of the object and the image.

 ⑵ **Type 2.** Spherical Mirror: Concave Mirror, Convex Mirror

> ① Spherical and Parabolic Mirrors

>> ○ Spherical mirrors have a constant curvature but parallel rays do not converge exactly to a single point.

>> ○ Parabolic mirrors have parallel rays that converge exactly to a single point.

> ② Focal Length

>> ○ When the object distance is ∞, the image is at the focal point.

>> ○ For a spherical mirror, f = R / 2

> ③ Construction Method

>> ○ Parallel rays pass through the focus.

>> ○ Rays passing through the focus travel parallel to the optical axis.

>> ○ Rays heading towards the center of the mirror reflect symmetrically about the optical axis.

>> ○ Rays passing through the center of the lens continue in a straight line.

> ④ Proof of Concave Mirror 1: A construction using only two rays does not require approximation.

**Figure. 4.** Proof of Concave Mirror 1

> ⑤ Proof of Concave Mirror 2: A construction using arbitrary rays requires approximation.

**Figure. 5.** Proof of Concave Mirror 2

> ⑤ Spherical Aberration: When not dealing with paraxial rays

>> ○ When not dealing with paraxial rays, parallel rays do not converge to the focus (because it is not a parabolic mirror).

>> ○ In the case of paraxial rays: Quadratic function, i.e., equation

 of parabola

 ⑶ **Type 3.** Spherical Lens: Convex Lens, Concave Lens

> ① Construction Method

>> ○ Parallel rays pass through the focus.

>> ○ Rays passing through the focus travel parallel to the optical axis.

>> ○ Rays heading towards the center of the lens reflect symmetrically about the optical axis.

>> ○ Rays passing through the center of the lens continue in a straight line.

 ⑷ Spherical Boundary

> ① Proof of Spherical Boundary

**Figure. 6.** Proof of Spherical Boundary

> ② Apparent Depth

>> ○ The apparent depth appears greater when looking from outside the water into the water (this can be approached using the concept of visual angle).

>> ○ Proof: Negative values imply imaginary.

## **3\. Optical Devices**

 ⑴ Optical Devices

> ① Converges incoming light from the outside to form an image on the retina.

> ② Mainly, light is well refracted at the cornea.

> ③ The lens finely adjusts the refractive index.

 ⑵ Magnifying Glass ↔ Telescope

> ① Since we should be able to see comfortably with our eyes, the near point (25 cm) is important.

> ② Magnification factor m

>> ○ To understand how an optical device magnifies an object, we need to consider the size of the image formed on the retina.

>> ○ The magnification factor or angular magnification m of a device is the ratio of the angular size of an object with the device to the angular size of the same object without the device.

> ③ Calculation of Magnification

>> ○ The magnification is the greatest when the object is at the near point, i.e., when q = -25 cm.

>> ○ The most comfortable state for the eye is when the object is at an infinite distance.

 ⑶ Microscope

**Figure. 8.** Microscope

> ① Placing the object at the focal length gives the highest magnification.

> ② Visible light has a significantly larger wavelength compared to atoms, making direct observation impossible.

> ③ When trying to see electrons with light, λ↓ → E↑

 ⑷ Telescope

**Figure. 9.** Telescope

> ① Collecting Power: R ↑, N ↑, t ↑

> ② Resolution: R ↑, λ ↓

> ③ Refraction: Cannot create a large angular separation

> ④ Reflection: Reflection can block objects at the position where the image is formed.

> ⑤ Example: A refracting telescope consists of two convex lenses separated by a distance of 100 cm. If the focal length of the objective lens is 20 cm, what is the angular magnification mθ of the telescope?

 ⑸ Astronomical Telescope

> ① Magnification = Focal length of objective lens ÷ Focal length of eyepiece lens

> ② Aligning the polar axis: To easily track celestial bodies in their daily motion.

> ③ Types

>> ○ Optical telescopes: Most affected by weather conditions.

>> ○ Radio telescopes: Observing electromagnetic waves from the ground.

>> ○ Space telescopes: Observing short-wavelength electromagnetic waves that can't be observed from the ground. Suitable for observing high-temperature celestial bodies.

 ⑹ Aberration

> ① Spherical Aberration: A phenomenon where not dealing with paraxial rays shortens the focal length.

> ② Chromatic Aberration: Refractive index varies with wavelength, causing shorter wavelengths to have shorter focal lengths.
