## **1\. Apoptosis and necrosis**

⑴ Apoptosis

> ① Do not damage surrounding cells.

> ② Signaling mechanism by caspase is involved.

>> ○ Caspase **:** Related to Initiation of apoptosis and digestion of intracellular components.

> ③ Uses ATP.

> ④ Progresses slowly.

> ⑤ Forms blebs, i.e. membrane deformation.

> ⑥ Affected by phagocytosis.

⑵ Necrosis

> ① Damages to surrounding cells.

> ② Signaling mechanism by caspase is not involved.

> ③ Do not use ATP.

> ④ Suddenly progresses.

> ⑤ Inflammatory reaction is involved.

> ⑥ Not affected by phagocytosis.

## **2. Initial phase and later phase of apoptosis**

⑴ Initial phase of apoptosis

> ① The asymmetry of membrane is broken.

>> Ex**.** Phosphatydil serine

⑵ Later phase of apoptosis

> ① There occurs holes on membrane like necrosis.

<br>

## **3. Apoptosis and dietary cells**

⑴ If dietary cells encounter foreign substances, they shall not be destroyed as scheduled.

⑵ Ex. TLR(toll-like receptor)

> ① Iκ-B and NF-κB are involved.

> ② NF-κB is usually present in cytoplasm in combination with Iκ-B protein.

> ③ If an external stimulus (e.g. TLR) is present, NF-κB is separated from Iκ-B and moved to the nucleus.
