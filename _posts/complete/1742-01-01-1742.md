⑴ (note) quantile

> ① quantile function**:** inverse function of cumulative distribution function Φ

>> ○ <span>domain **:**｛x | 0 ≤ x ≤ 1｝</span>

>> ○ range **:** statistics of the group of interest 

> ② depending on the number of sections, there are percentages, quartiles, etc.

⑵ definition**:** a set of points (x, y) as follows 

> ① <span>｛(x, y) | Φ = P(X ＜ x) = P(Y ＜ y)｝</span>

> ② note that x is the statistic of the standard normal distribution and y is the statistic of the sample group 

⑶ case study

> ① when the sample group follows a normal distribution**:** Q-Q plot is close to a straight line

> ② if the distribution of samples is skewed to the right 

>> ○ (note) skewness ＜ 0 

>> ○ idea **:** you can think of dragging each point to the right from the existing normal distribution

>> ○ since the random variable of each point increases, each point on the Q-Q plot moves upward from the diagonal

> ③ if the distribution of samples is skewed to the left 

>> ○ (note) skewness ＞ 0

>> ○ idea **:** you can think of dragging each point to the left from the existing normal distribution

>> ○ since the random variable of each point decreases, each point on the Q-Q plot moves downward from the diagonal
