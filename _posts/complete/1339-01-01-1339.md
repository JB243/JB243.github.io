**Figure. 1.** Concentration of salt and solubility 

 ⑴ Low Concentration of Salt

> ① Solubility increases as salt is added

> ② Reason **:** Salt-induced changes in substances aid water penetration

 ⑵ High Concentration of Salt

> ① Solubility decreases as salt is added

> ② Reason **:** Salts surround the entire substance, decreasing interaction with water

 ⑶ The higher the amount of target substance, the larger the peak value of solubility

 ⑷ Initial means of purification, frequently using ammonium sulfate

## **6\. Chromatography:** Solution

 ⑴ Classification based on polarity and non-polarity

> ① Terms

>> ○ Stationary phase **:** Fixed substance

>> ○ Mobile phase **:** Moving substance

>> ○ Partition coefficient **:** Affinity difference between stationary and mobile phases for various substances

>> ○ Chromatography **:** Method of separation based on time differences due to partition coefficients

> ② Normal-phase Chromatography: When the mobile phase is non-polar and the stationary phase is polar

>> ○ Substances with greater distance traveled have stronger hydrophobicity

>> ○ Toluene is frequently used as a mobile phase

>> ○ Example **:** Ion-exchange chromatography

> ③ Reversed-phase Chromatography: When the mobile phase is polar and the stationary phase is non-polar

>> ○ Substances with greater distance traveled have stronger hydrophilicity

>> ○ Example **:** Partition chromatography

 ⑵ Classification based on form

> ① Thin-layer Chromatography (TLC): Used to monitor the progress of reactions

>> ○ Principle **:** Interaction difference between sample and silica gel

>> ○ Purpose **:** Determine reaction progress and termination

>> ○ Normal phase silica gel: Strongly polar, affinity with the sample increases with sample polarity

>> ○ Stationary phase is silica gel (strongest polarity), mobile phase is eluent (non-polar)

>> ○ Definition of Rf **:** Distance traveled by the sample ÷ Distance traveled by the solvent

>> ○ Comparing Rf for different samples

>>> ○ Acids, bases, metal salts < Carboxylic acids, amines, amides < Alcohols < Aldehydes, ketones < Alkyl halides < Esters < Alkenes ＜ Alkynes

>>> ○ **Trend 1.** The higher the sample's polarity, the stronger the interaction with silica gel, leading to a lower Rf value

>>> ○ **Trend 2.** Amines and hydroxyl groups have less polarity compared to nitro groups, but due to hydrogen bonding, they have lower Rf values

>>> ○ **Trend 3.** _trans_ alkenes have lower Rf values than _cis_ alkenes (because they interact more)

>>> ○ Example **:** In a paper chromatography and chlorophyll separation experiment, Rf values are in the order: carotinoid > xanthophyll > chlorophyll a > chlorophyll b (using toluene as the solvent)

>> ○ Comparing Rf values with organic solvents

>>> ○ Water ＜ Acetic acid ＜ Alcohols ＜ Ethyl acetate ＜ CH2Cl2 ＜ Toluene ＜ CCl4 ＜ n-Hexane

>>> ○ **Trend 1.** The higher the polarity of the eluent, the more the sample moves, leading to an increased Rf value

>>> ○ Ethyl acetate: Representative polar eluent

>>> ○ n-Hexane: Representative non-polar eluent

> ② Column Chromatography: Divided into ion-exchange, affinity, and size exclusion chromatography

> ③ Ion-exchange Chromatography

>> ○ Definition **:** Chromatography using beads with attached target substance (e.g., protein)

>> ○ Anion-exchange or positive ion exchange resin chromatography

>>> ○ Utilizes negatively charged beads

>>> ○ Aims to separate positively charged molecules (e.g., proteins with high isoelectric points)

>>> ○ Molecules with more negative charge are eluted faster

>> ○ Cation-exchange or negative ion exchange resin chromatography

>>> ○ Utilizes positively charged beads

>>> ○ Aims to separate negatively charged molecules (e.g., proteins with low isoelectric points)

>>> ○ Molecules with more positive charge are eluted faster

> ④ Affinity Chromatography

>> ○ Utilizes differences in affinity with the adsorbent to separate target substances; highly effective separation method

> ⑤ Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)

>> ○ Uses a porous matrix that only allows small molecules to pass through: larger molecules have faster elution

>> ○ Molecular weight range of samples: 1.2 × 102 ~ 1.1 × 106

>> ○ Examples: PD-10 desalting column, gel-filtration chromatography, Sephacryl S300 column chromatography

> ⑥ High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)

>> ○ Molecular weight range of samples: 6 × 101 ~ 104

>> ○ Components: solvent, pump, injector, column, detector, recorder

>> ○ UV detector most widely used in HPLC

>> ○ RI detector is sensitive to environmental changes like pressure and temperature, but not very sensitive to solute concentration

> ⑦ Gas Chromatography (GC)

>> ○ Definition **:** Separation of evaporated sample components through distribution between a stationary phase and a moving gas phase in a separation tube

>> ○ Carrier gas is usually helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, or argon: typically helium is used as it is an inert gas

>>> ○ **Reason 1.** Light gas molecules like H2 and He have high diffusion coefficients, leading to faster separation

>>> ○ **Reason 2.** Light gas molecules like H2 and He have high thermal conductivity, so the preheating time is short

>>> ○ **Reason 3.** Gases like H2 and O2 can react with the sample

>> ○ Advantages: High resolution

>> ○ Disadvantages: Requires volatile samples, so molecules should be small

>>> ○ Molecular weight range of samples: 100 ~ 103

>>> ○ Generally, when molecular weight exceeds 500, gas chromatography becomes difficult

>> ○ **Application 1:** GLC (gas-liquid chromatography) and GSC (gas-solid chromatography)

>> ○ **Application 2:** Molecular weight can be measured using gas chromatography: utilizing the relationship between retention time and molecular weight

>> ○ **Application 3:** GC-MS (gas chromatography mass spectrography)

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Substances separated in gas chromatography are ionized or chemically ionized, then sorted based on mass

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Sorted substances form unique mass spectra

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. This is compared to accumulated library data for structural information or quantitative analysis

>>> ○ 1st ionization is selective, and 2nd ionization is performed to quantify very small amounts of components

> ⑧ Paper Chromatography
