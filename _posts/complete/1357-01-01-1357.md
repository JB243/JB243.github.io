## **3\. Organic Chemistry Nomenclature**

⑴ As the numbers 4, 5, 6, ... increase, the higher rule takes precedence.

⑵ **Priority of Functional Groups** **:** Higher priority with higher placement

> ① Carboxyl group (-COOH)

> ② Acid anhydride

> ③ Ester group (-COOR)

> ④ Alkyl halide (-COX)

> ⑤ Amide group (-CONR2)

> ⑥ Cyanide group (nitrile) (-CN)

> ⑦ Aldehyde group (-RCHO)

> ⑧ Ketone group (-RCOR')

> ⑨ Alcohol group (hydroxy group) (-OH)

> ⑩ Thiol group (-SH)

> ⑪ Amino group (-NH2)

> ⑫ Imine group

> ⑬ Alkene and alkyne **:** Alkene takes priority if the numbers are the same

> ⑭ Alkane

> ⑮ R-O-R'

> ⑯ R-S-R'

> ⑰ Halogen group

> ⑱ Nitro group

⑶ Priority Supplement

> ① When there are three or more functional groups with different priorities, except for the top one, the rest are considered equal.

>> ○ Example **:** 3-bromo-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde (Priority: -CHO > -OH, -Br)

> ② Priority of alkene and alkyne is equal, but if their numbers are the same, alkane takes priority.

⑷ Common Rules

> ① Main chain selection **:** Find the main functional group, select the main chain, and treat the rest as substituents (side chains).

> ② Substituent naming

> ③ Numbering

>> ○ Higher priority functional groups should have lower numbers.

>> ○ Rule of lower-position priority **:** If multiple possibilities exist, choose the arrangement where the carbons bearing the functional groups have the smallest possible numbers.

>>> ○ Example **:** 5-ethyl-2,5-dimethylheptane (O)

>>> ○ Example **:** 3-ethyl-3,6-dimethylheptane (X)

>> ○ If numbers are the same, give lower numbers to the earlier functional group in alphabetical order.

>> ○ If numbers are already determined, numbering can be omitted.

>>> ○ Example **:** methylcyclohexene (O)

>>> ○ Example **:** methyl-1-cyclohexene (X)

> ④ Suffixes

>> ○ If alkenes and alkynes do not affect the main functional group, use only the main functional group as the suffix.

>> ○ Alkenes and alkynes affect the suffix (e.g., enol, yne, -enoic acid).

> ⑤ Complete name naming

>> ○ Rearrange functional groups of equal priority in alphabetical order.

>>> ○ Prefixes like di(2), tri(3), etc., are not considered in alphabetical order.

>>> ○ For common names of substituents, consider iso, neo, cyclo, etc., when assigning alphabetical order.

>>> ○ For common names of substituents, separations like _sec-_ and _tert-_ are not included in alphabetical order.

>> ○ Name as 《(Substituent position-Substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + Main chain + Suffix.》

>> ○ Main chain naming rules

> ① In **2.**, assume that there are only alkyl groups and halogen groups as substituents, and their priorities are equal.

> ② Alkyl groups (alkyl) **:** If alkane or cycloalkane acts as a substituent, change -ane to -yl.

>> ○ Alkyl groups based on the number of carbons

| 9 | _nonyl_ |
| 10 | _decyl_ |

**Table. 4.** Alkyl Groups based on the Number of Carbons

<br>

>> ○ The carbon nearest to the main chain is labeled as 1.

>> ○ Alkyl groups can be represented as R groups.

>> ○ Some R groups are expressed as abbreviations (e.g., me for methyl group, et for ethyl group, pro for propyl group).

>> ○ alkyl (e.g., ethyl), alkenyl (e.g., ethenyl), alkynyl (e.g., ethynyl) have equal priority

>> ○ Common names **:** (note) **Memorize**

>>> ○ isopropyl (1-methylethyl)

>>> ○ _sec_ -butyl (1-methylpropyl), isobutyl (2-methylpropyl), _tert_ -butyl (1,1-dimethylethyl)

>>> ○ isopentyl or isoamyl (3-methylbutyl), neopentyl (2,2-dimethylpropyl)

> ③ Halogen groups **:** When a halogen element acts as a substituent, replace with -o.

>> ○ Example **:** fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo

> ④ If the same substituent occurs more than once, add a prefix indicating the number.

>> ○ Example **:** di(2), tri(3), tetra(4), penta(5), hexa(6)

⑶ Numbering

> ① Assign sequential numbers to carbons along the main chain from one end to the other.

> ② When there is one substituent, give the minimum number to the carbon bearing the substituent.

> ③ When there are two or more substituents, give the carbon bearing the substituent a lower number, even if it's just one carbon less.

>> ○ Example **:** 2,6,6-trimethyloctane (O)

>> ○ Example **:** 3,3,7-trimethyloctane (X)

> ④ If numbers are the same, give lower numbers to the substituent attached to the earlier carbon in alphabetical order.

>> ○ Example **:** 1-bromo-5-chloropentane (O)

>> ○ Example **:** 1-chloro-5-bromopentane (X)

⑷ Complete Name Naming

> ① List substituents in alphabetical order.

>> ○ Example **:** 4-ethyl-3-methyloctane

>> ○ Prefixes like di(2), tri(3), etc., are not considered in alphabetical order.

>>> ○ Example **:** 4-ethyl-2,3-dimethylheptane (O)

>>> ○ Example **:** 2,3-dimethyl-4-ethylheptane (X)

>>> ○ Exceptionally, if a substituent has another substituent, include it in the alphabetical order.

>>>> ○ Example **:** 7-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)-4-ethyldodecane

>> ○ When using common names of substituents, consider iso, neo, cyclo, etc., when assigning alphabetical order.

>>> ○ Example **:** isopropyl > methyl

>> ○ When using common names of substituents, separations like _sec-_ and _tert-_ are not included in alphabetical order.

>>> ○ Example **:** sec-butyl > ethyl

> ② Name as 《(Substituent position-Substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + Main chain + Suffix.》

>> ○ However, for alkanes, the suffix is -ane.

⑸ For complex substituents, consider one substituent, enclose its name in parentheses, and include it in alphabetical order.

> ① The part of the substituent adjacent to the main chain is assigned carbon 1.

> ② Example

>> ○ Example **:** 4-(2-methylhexyl)octane

>> ○ Example **:** 7-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)-4-ethyldecane

<br>

<br>

## 5. Cyclic Alkane Nomenclature

⑴ Cases with only cycloalkanes

> ① For cycloalkanes, add "cyclo" in front of the name of the corresponding alkane based on the number of carbons.

> ② Examples: cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane

⑵ Naming the main chain

> ① According to the existing IUPAC guidelines

>> ○ **Case 1:** When both acyclic and cyclic alkane structures coexist: Represent the cyclic alkane as a substituent in the following cases:

>>> ○ When the substituent has a larger number of carbons

>>> ○ When multiple rings are present

>>> ○ When neither can be chosen as the parent structure

>> ○ **Case 2:** When the number of carbons in the acyclic alkane chain and the cyclic alkane are the same, consider the cyclic alkane as the parent structure.

> ② [**Latest IUPAC Guidelines**](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/19229/is-
the-ring-or-the-chain-chosen-as-the-parent-structure-in-octan-2-ylbenzene): In cases where both ring and chain structures are present, the ring is chosen as the parent structure.

>> ○ Example: octylcyclobutane (preferred)

⑶ When a cyclic alkane is the main chain:

> ① If there is only one substituent, numbering is not necessary.

>> ○ Example: methylcyclohexane

> ② When multiple numbering methods are possible, assign numbers so that at least one is the smallest possible number (ref).

>> ○ Example: 1-chloro-2,2,3-trimethylcyclopropane (X), 2-chloro-1,1,3-trimethylcyclopropane (O)

> ③ When there are two or more substituents, name the substituents, number the positions, and then name the entire molecule.

>> ○ The carbon attached to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order is numbered 1.

>> ○ Example: 1-ethyl-2-methylcyclopentane

⑷ When an acyclic alkane is the main chain: It is necessary to indicate the number of the cyclic position.

> ① Example: 1-cyclobutylpentane

<br>

<br>

## **6. Complex Cyclic Alkane Nomenclature**

⑴ Bicycloalkanes or bridged rings

> ① Investigate the path from one bridgehead carbon to another.

> ② Count the number of carbons excluding the bridgehead carbon in each path and write it as [x.y.z] in decreasing order.

> ③ Numbering:

>> ○ **Step 1.** Number each carbon starting from one at each bridgehead, following the longest path.

>> ○ **Step 2.** Number the largest ring first.

**Figure 1.** Nomenclature of Bicyclic Alkanes

<br>

>> ○ **Step 3.** In cases where multiple possibilities compete, assign numbers such that any carbon with a substituent gets a lower number.

**Figure 2.** Nomenclature of Bicyclic Alkanes

<br>

> ④ Naming format: 《(substituent position + substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + bicyclo[x.y.z]alkane》, where _alkane_ indicates the total number of carbons.

>> ○ Example: 3,3-dimethylbicyclo[3.2.1]octane

⑵ Fused rings (e.g., steroids)

> ① Investigate the path from one bridgehead carbon to another.

> ② Count the number of carbons excluding the bridgehead carbon in each path and write it as [x.y.0] in decreasing order.

>> ○ Fused rings have directly connected shared carbons, always represented as z = 0.

> ③ Numbering: Follow the procedure of ⑴-③.

> ④ Naming format: 《(substituent position-substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + bicyclo[x.y.0]alkane》, where _alkane_ indicates the total number of carbons.

>> ○ Example: 8-methylbicyclo[4.3.0]nonane

⑶ Spiro rings

> ① Investigate the path from one bridgehead carbon to itself.

> ② Count the number of carbons excluding the bridgehead carbon in each path and write it as [x.z] in increasing order.

> ③ Different from bicycloalkanes and fused rings due to not having a bridgehead carbon at 1.

> ④ Numbering: Follow the procedure of ⑴-③.

> ⑤ Naming format: 《(substituent position-substituent name)n \+ bicylo[x.z]alkane》, where _alkane_ indicates the total number of carbons.

>> ○ Example: 1-bromo-3-chlorospiro[4.5]decan-7-ol

<br>

<br>

## **7. Acyclic Alkene and Alkyne Nomenclature**

⑴ Choosing the main chain

> ① Assuming functional groups are only alkyl, halogen, alkene, and alkyne.

> ② Alkene and alkyne take precedence over alkane, so choose the longest carbon chain containing alkene and alkyne as the main chain and the rest as substituents.

⑵ Substituent naming

> ① Naming of alkyl and halogen groups is the same as for alkanes.

⑶ Numbering

> ① Assign sequential numbers to carbons from one end of the main chain to the other.

> ② Alkenes and alkynes take precedence over substituents, so assign the lowest number to them.

>> ○ Only indicate the position of the first carbon for multiple bonds.

>> ○ Example: 4-methyl-2-pentene

> ③ When two combinations of numbers are possible, choose the one with the alkene or alkyne having a lower number.

> ④ When numbers are the same, choose the combination where the alkene (alk _e_ ne) comes before the alkyne (alk _y_ ne) in alphabetical order.

>> ○ Example: 1-penten-4-yne

> ⑤ When two combinations of numbers are still possible after ④ and there's only one substituent, assign the number to the carbon with the substituent to minimize its position.

> ⑥ When two combinations of numbers are still possible after ④ and there's only one carbon in the substituent, assign a lower number to minimize its position.

> ⑦ When numbers are the same after ⑥, assign the smaller number to the one that comes first in alphabetical order.

⑷ Suffix naming

> ① If there's only one alkene: Named as 《··· + alkene position-ene》.

> ② If there's only one alkyne: Named as 《··· + alkyne position-yne》.

> ③ If there's one alkene and one alkyne: Named as 《··· + alkene position-en-alkyne position-yne》.

> ④ If there's more than one alkene or alkyne:

>> ○ For alkenes: Change -ene to -diene(2), -triene(3), -tetraene(4), etc., based on the number of alkenes.

>>> ○ Example: 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene

>> ○ For alkynes: Change -yne to -diyne(2), -triyne(3), -tetrayne(4), etc., based on the number of alkynes.

⑸ Complete name naming

> ① Named as 《(substituent position-substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + alk-alkene/alkyne position-suffix》.

> ② For the alkane part (_alk_), it should end with a consonant. If there's a consonant conflict, leave it as -a.

>> ○ Example: hept-1-ene (no -a), hexa-1,3-diene (with -a)

<br>

<br>

## **8. Cyclic Alkene and Alkyne Nomenclature**

⑴ Choosing the main chain

> ① When the cyclic alkene or alkyne is attached to an alkane, the cyclic alkene or alkyne takes priority, making it the main chain.

> ② When the cyclic alkene or alkyne is attached to an acyclic alkane or alkyne

⑵ Substituent naming

> ① Naming of alkyl and halogen groups is the same as for alkanes.

> ② If cyclic and acyclic alkenes or alkynes act as substituents, they are named as -enyl or -ynyl instead of -ene or -yne.

>> ○ The carbon closest to the substituent in the main chain is numbered as 1.

⑶ Numbering

> ① Assign numbers to make the alkene or alkyne between carbons 1 and 2.

⑴ Substituent naming

⑵ Numbering

> ① When there's only one substituent, no separate numbering is assigned.

> ② Arrange the numbers to make the carbon attached to the higher-priority group (functional group) have the lower number.

>> ○ The highest-priority group gets the number 1.

> ③ When multiple options are possible, choose the numbering where the carbon attached to the higher-priority group has fewer numbers.

> ④ Even so, if multiple cases are possible, substituents should be numbered in alphabetical order, giving the lower numbers to the substituents that come first alphabetically.
