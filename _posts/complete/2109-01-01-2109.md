## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Limits of existing spatial transcriptomics

> ① Difficulty in determining the location of specific cell types

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Difficulty arises because not just single cells but dozens to hundreds of cells can be placed on spatial transcriptomics spots.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Even if only a few cells are placed on a spot, they are not recognized as individual cells but as a new single cell.

> ② Drawbacks of existing unsupervised marker-dependent analysis2

>> ○ **Drawback 1.** Doesn't control issues like platform effects, Poisson sampling, over-dispersed counts, etc.

>> ○ **Drawback 2.** Performance is not significantly superior.

> ③ Drawbacks of existing MIA (multimodal intersection analysis)3

>> ○ **Drawback 1.** Doesn't control issues like platform effects, Poisson sampling, over-dispersed counts, etc.

>> ○ **Drawback 2.** Not validated in large-scale spatial transcriptomics like Slide-seq.

>> ○ **Drawback 3.** Difficult to adjust parameters, leading to bias towards enhancement or depletion.

>> ○ **Drawback 4.** Results are sensitive to parameter changes.

>> ○ **Drawbacks 1** and **Drawback 2** are points highlighted in the paper, while **Drawbacks 3** and **Drawback 4** are the author's perspective as a practitioner.

⑵ RCTD (Robust Cell Type Decomposition)

> ① Features: Able to distinguish specific cell types in spatial transcriptomics data. Supervised.

> ② **Significance 1:** Unlike other supervised methods, it can differentiate **multiple cell types** within a specific spot.

> ③ **Significance 2:** Can control platform effects: Without controlling platform effects in a supervised method, technical variability can hinder successful analysis of biological signals.

## **2\. Mathematical Theory**

⑴ Statistical Model

> ① Essentially follows the Poisson model.

>> ○ Applicable even when UMI count is low, like in Slide-seq.

> ② i **:** Each spot. 1, ..., I

> ③ j **:** Each gene. 1, ..., J

> ④ k **:** Each cell type. 1, ..., K

> ⑤ Yi,j **:** Gene expression of gene j at spot i (unit: count)

> ⑥ λi,j **:** Random probability variable reflecting platform effect and other natural variability (unit: none)

> ⑦ Ni **:** Total transcript count of each spot, referred to as UMI (unique molecular identifier)

> ⑧ αi **:** Spot-specific fixed effect

> ⑨ γj **:** Gene-specific fixed effect

>> ○ Platform-specific like scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, Slide-seq, Smart-seq.

>> ○ Assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation σγ.

> ⑩ μk,j **:** Mean gene expression of gene j in cell type k (unit: normalized expression)

> ⑪ βi,k **:** Weight for cell type k at spot i

>> ○ **Condition 1:** βi,k \+ ··· + βi,K = 1

>> ○ **Condition 2:** βi,k ≥ 0

>> ○ Once β values are determined, the model can be completed.

> ⑫ εi,j **:** Random effect influencing gene expression of gene j at spot i. Related to gene-specific overdispersion.

>> ○ Assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation σε.

⑵ Supervised Learning

> ① **Step 1:** Assuming μk,j from the reference, it is assumed that these values will be the same in spatial transcriptomics.

>> ○ The average expression of gene j for all single cells of cell type k in the reference.

> ② **Step 2:** Exclude genes that do not show significant differences between cell types (**∵** to improve analysis performance).

>> ○ Approximately 5,000 genes out of 30,000 genes remain.

> ③ **Step 3:** Interestingly, γj can be determined by expanding the following formula.

>> ○ **Sub-step 1:** Sj ≡ ∑(i = 1 to I) Yi,j

>> ○ **Sub-step 2:** (First equality) Using E(Y) = λ for Y ~ Poisson(λ) ([Poisson distribution](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1626))

>>> ○ The sum of sample means for Yi,j with respect to i also follows a Poisson distribution. The following is the proof.

>>> ○ Property of moment-generating functions: ψX1+X2(t) = ψX1(t) × ψX2(t)

>>> ○ **Assumption:** X1 ~ Poisson(λ1), X2 ~ Poisson(λ2)

>>> ○ ψX1(t) = exp(λ1et \- λ1), ψX2(t) = exp(λ2et \- λ2)

>>> ○ ΨX1+X2(t) = exp((λ1+λ2)et \- (λ1+λ2))

>>> ○ **Conclusion:** X1 \+ X2 ~ Poisson(λ1 \+ λ2)

>> ○ **Sub-step 3:** (Second equality)

>>> ○ **3-1.** Substitute λi,j

>>> ○ **3-2.** Separate the γj term: Easily separable since it is independent of i.

>>> ○ **3-3.** Change the order of ∑ (i = 1 to I) and ∑ (k = 1 to K)

>> ○ **Sub-step 4:** If I is sufficiently large, Var(Bk,j) converges to 0 (supplementary method), making Bk,j ≒ βk.

>> ○ **Sub-step 5:** Estimate β0, βk, σγ through maximum likelihood estimation for Sj.

>> ○ **Sub-step 6:** Randomly assign γj using σγ.

> ④ **Step 4:** (RCTD)

>> ○ Can estimate αi, βi,k, σε for Yi,j through maximum likelihood estimation when varying gene j within a specific spot.

⑶ Optimized Supervised Learning

> ① Assume a maximum of 2 overlapping cell types per spot: i.e., spot is a singlet or doublet.

> ② Of course, you can limit the maximum number of cell types per spot or even not set any limitations at all.

> ③ Optimization prevents overfitting: Singlets have only one cell type per spot, so **doublets are desirable

## **4. Results**

⑴ Challenge

> ① Reconfirmation of drawbacks in existing unsupervised marker-dependent analysis

>> ○ **Drawback 1:** Unclear distinction of marker genes when colocalizing, like Bergmann cells and Purkinje cells **:** Unsupervised learning recognizes them as a new single cell when they colocalize (Fig. 1a)

>> ○ **Drawback 2:** Misclassification of granule cells during granule cell classification (Fig. 1b, c)

> ② Reconfirmation of drawbacks in existing supervised analysis

>> ○ Drawback: Cross-platform cell type classification performance is not significantly excellent (Fig. 1d, e)

> ③ RCTD can resolve these issues

>> ○ RCTD can effectively remove platform effects (Fig. 2b)

>> ○ RCTD shows high cross-platform single-cell classification accuracy (Fig. 2c)

>> ○ RCTD captures Bergmann cells well even in Bergmann-Purkinje doublet situations (Fig. 3c)

>> ○ If a reference cell type does not exist, it is often misclassified as a wrong cell type (supplementary Fig. 11)

⑵ Mouse Cerebellum Sample

> ① Structure of mouse cerebellum

**Figure. 4.** Structure of mouse cerebellum

> ② snRNA-seq reference × Slide-seqV2

>> ○ The resulting cell types accurately reflect the spatial architecture of the cerebellum (Fig. 4a)

>> ○ RCTD, set in singlet and doublet modes, correctly distinguishes Purkinje cells and Bergmann cells (Fig. 4b, 4c)

>> ○ Comparison with actual markers shows excellent correspondence (Fig. 4d)

> ③ scRNA-seq reference × Slide-seqV2

>> ○ 95.7% agreement between cell type prediction in snRNA-seq reference × Slide-seqV2

>> ○ Other analyses demonstrate RCTD's consistency as well

⑶ Hippocampus Sample

> ① Co-localization of RCTD-based interneuron cell types and interneuron markers (Fig. 5b)

> ② Co-localization of sub-clusters within RCTD-based interneuron markers and Sst expression (Fig. 5c, 5d)

> ③ RCTD can demonstrate the influence of cellular environment on gene expression (Fig. 6g)

## **5\. Conclusion**

⑴ **Limit 1:** Assumes that platform effects are common to all cell types **:** Investigating cell-type-specific platform effects may be necessary.

⑵ **Limit 2:** Cell types present in spatial data but absent in the reference could be problematic.

⑶ Question **:** Unclear if the unit of μk,j is normalized expression.

⑷ Application **:** Could be extended to spatial transcriptomics × spatial transcriptomics analysis.
