## **1\. Definition of Waves**

⑴ Wave: Energy transmission without the movement of a medium (substance)

> ① Standing waves can be seen as exceptions.

> ② Thermal conduction fits the definition, but it is not a wave.

⑵ (Distinct Concept) Vibration: Periodic occurrence at a specific location. Waves propagate to different places.

⑶ (Distinct Concept) Pulse: A disturbance that passes through only once.

⑷ Wave Source: The point where a wave originates.

⑸ Medium: Substance that transmits waves.

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Types of Waves**

⑴ Classification based on the presence of a medium

> ① **Elastic Waves**: Mechanical waves that require a medium.

>> ○ External force causes deformation → deformation induces stress → stress causes deformation in adjacent molecules.

>> ○ Higher density leads to faster wave velocity.

>> ○ Examples: Surface waves, sound waves, seismic waves.

> ② **Particle Waves**: Do not require a medium.

>> ○ **Electromagnetic Waves (Light)**: Gauge-preserving; involve scalar, vector, and tensor components.

>> ○ **Gravitational Waves**: Gauge-preserving; involve scalar, vector, and tensor components.

>> ○ **Matter Waves**: Represent probability amplitude density; fermions → spinors (relatively accurate in a relativistic context).

⑵ Classification based on the direction of vibration

> ① Longitudinal waves (e.g., P-waves in earthquakes, sound waves, longitudinal waves in slinky)

>> ○ Definition: Waves in which the direction of propagation aligns with the direction of vibration of the medium.

>> ○ Vibration direction and energy transfer direction are parallel.

>> ○ Involvement of compressional forces.

> ② Transverse waves (e.g., S-waves in earthquakes, electromagnetic waves, transverse waves in slinky)

>> ○ Definition: Waves in which the direction of propagation is perpendicular to the direction of vibration of the medium.

>> ○ Vibration direction and energy transfer direction are perpendicular.

>> ○ Involvement of shear forces.

> ③ While water waves are classified as transverse waves, they also have a longitudinal component due to the circular motion of water particles.

⑶ Classification based on waveform

> ① Wavefront: A line or surface connecting points of equal phase, like a crest or trough.

> ② Plane waves: Wavefront forms a straight line.

> ③ Spherical waves: Wavefront forms a circle.

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Representation of Waves**

⑴ Crest: The point of maximum displacement in a wave.

⑵ Trough: The point of minimum displacement in a wave.

⑶ Amplitude: Maximum displacement of the medium during vibration.

⑷ Wavelength: Distance between two neighboring points in phase, such as crest to crest or trough to trough.

⑸ Period: Time T for a repeating pattern of a wave.

⑹ Frequency: Number of pattern repetitions per unit time, reciprocal of period (f).

⑺ Wave Velocity

⑼ Node: Point of minimum amplitude.
