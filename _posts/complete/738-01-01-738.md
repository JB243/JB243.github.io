## **1\. Definition of Waves**

 ⑴ Wave **:** Energy transmission without the movement of a medium (substance)

> ① Standing waves can be seen as exceptions.

> ② Thermal conduction fits the definition, but it is not a wave.

 ⑵ (Distinct Concept) Vibration **:** Periodic occurrence at a specific location. Waves propagate to different places.

  ⑶ (Distinct Concept) Pulse **:** A disturbance that passes through only once.

  ⑷ Wave Source **:** The point where a wave originates.

  ⑸ Medium **:** Substance that transmits waves.

## **2\. Types of Waves**

  ⑴ Classification based on the presence of a medium

> ① Elastic waves **:** Mechanical waves. Require a medium.

>> ○ External force causes deformation → Deformation induces stress → Stress causes deformation of adjacent molecules.

>> ○ Examples: Water waves, sound waves, seismic waves.

> ② Particle waves **:** Do not require a medium.

>> ○ Electromagnetic waves (light) **:** Gauge invariance, involvement of scalar, vector, tensor.

>> ○ Gravitational waves **:** Gauge invariance, involvement of scalar, vector, tensor.

>> ○ Matter waves **:** Probability amplitude density, Fermions → Spinors (approximately in the context of relativity)

  ⑵ Classification based on the direction of vibration

> ① Longitudinal waves (e.g., P-waves in earthquakes, sound waves, longitudinal waves in slinky)

>> ○ Definition: Waves in which the direction of propagation aligns with the direction of vibration of the medium.

>> ○ Vibration direction and energy transfer direction are parallel.

>> ○ Involvement of compressional forces.

> ② Transverse waves (e.g., S-waves in earthquakes, electromagnetic waves, transverse waves in slinky)

>> ○ Definition: Waves in which the direction of propagation is perpendicular to the direction of vibration of the medium.

>> ○ Vibration direction and energy transfer direction are perpendicular.

>> ○ Involvement of shear forces.

> ③ While water waves are classified as transverse waves, they also have a longitudinal component due to the circular motion of water particles.

  ⑶ Classification based on waveform

> ① Wavefront **:** A line or surface connecting points of equal phase, like a crest or trough.

> ② Plane waves **:** Wavefront forms a straight line.

> ③ Spherical waves **:** Wavefront forms a circle.

## **3\. Representation of Waves**

  ⑴ Crest **:** The point of maximum displacement in a wave.

  ⑵ Trough **:** The point of minimum displacement in a wave.

  ⑶ Amplitude **:** Maximum displacement of the medium during vibration.

  ⑷ Wavelength **:** Distance between two neighboring points in phase, such as crest to crest or trough to trough.

  ⑸ Period **:** Time T for a repeating pattern of a wave.

  ⑹ Frequency **:** Number of pattern repetitions per unit time, reciprocal of period (f).

  ⑺ Wave Velocity

  ⑻ Antinode **:** Point of maximum amplitude.

  ⑼ Node **:** Point of minimum amplitude.

  ⑽ Example

> ① (a) represents the situation at t = 0, and (b) represents the situation at t = 1 s.

> ② From (a), we can determine that λ = 4 m.

> ③ From (a) and (b), we can determine that v = 1 m/s.

> ④ Frequency can be determined using the formula.

  ⑶ Wave Velocity **:** Speed at which a wave propagates.

> ① Phase velocity **:** Tracing points with the same phase.

>> ○ ω/k ＞ 0 **:** vp ＞ 0, indicating forward propagation.

>> ○ ω/k ＜ 0 **:** vp ＜ 0, indicating backward propagation.

> ② **Example 1.** String Waves

>> ○ **Proof 1.** Dimensional analysis

>>> ○ [μ] = ML-1

>>> ○ [T] = MLT-2

>>> ○ [v] = LT-1

>>> ○ [（T / μ）0.5 ] = [v] ⇔ v ∝ （T / μ）0.5

>> ○ **Proof 2.** Derived from the wave equation
