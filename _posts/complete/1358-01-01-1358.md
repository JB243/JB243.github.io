⑶ **Stereoisomers**

> ① Definition: Isomers with the same atomic bonding order but different spatial arrangement

>> ○ Such stereoisomers are known as stereoselective products

> ② **Type 1:** Enantiomers (Optical Isomers, Enantiomorphs): Stereoisomers that do not overlap with their mirror images

> ③ **Type 2:** Diastereomers: All stereoisomers except enantiomers

> ④ **Type 2-1:** Geometrical Isomers: Stereoisomers within diastereomers with different spatial arrangements

>> ○ Types

>>> ○ _cis_-Isomers: When two substituents are on the same side (e.g., _cis_-1,3-dimethylcyclobutane)

>>> ○ _trans_-Isomers: When two substituents are on opposite sides (e.g., _trans_-1-bromo-3-ethylcyclopentane)

>> ○ **Type 1:** Fixed positions due to double bonds

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/11fe7899-09d5-4932-8980-112b8d1fde9e)

**Figure 6.** Fixed positions due to double bonds

<br>

>> ○ **Type 2:** Fixed positions due to rotational hindrance

>>> ○ Rotation might not be possible even with single bonds

>>> ○ Geometrical isomers can arise when two substituents on a cycloalkane are attached to different carbons

<br>

>>> ○ Used in monosaccharides, disaccharides

>> ○ **Anomer**

>>> ○ Isomers in which the absolute configuration of the acetal or hemiacetal carbon differs

>>> ○ Used in monosaccharides, disaccharides

>>> ○ [Anomeric Effect](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1356): The phenomenon where substituents next to a heteroatom in cyclohexane prefer an axial orientation.

 ⑷ Optical Resolution

> ① Structural and diastereomeric isomers exhibit different physical and chemical properties, enabling separation

> ② Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties except for the direction of [specific rotation of plane-polarized light](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1358)

> ③ Optical resolution: Special methods required to separate enantiomers

<br>

<br>

## **2. E-Z Nomenclature**

⑴ Priority Rules (CIP rule, Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule)

> ① **Rule 1:** Higher priority for atoms bonded directly to carbons with larger atomic numbers

> ② **Rule 2:** If two atoms have the same atomic number, priority goes to the one with the larger atomic number substituent

>> ○ In the absence of double bonds, if any one of the three 2-layer atoms has a substituent with a higher atomic number, it takes priority

> ③ **Rule 3:** If 2-layer atoms can't be compared, continue comparing with 3-layer, 4-layer, ... until a difference is found.

>> ○ Transition to (n+1)-layer atoms is possible after comparing all n-layer atoms.

> ④ **Rule 4:** Unshared electron pairs are considered the lowest priority

> ⑤ **Rule 5:** For multiple bonds, imagine replacing each multiple bond with single bonds. Then, treat each atom in the original bond as if it has the other atom as a substituent.

**Figure 9.** Priority rules for multiple bonds

<br>

⑵ E-Z Nomenclature

> ① Introduction: The cis/trans nomenclature is applicable only when there are exactly two of each substituent on an alkene

> ② Z Isomer: Higher-priority substituent is on the same side as cis, derived from the German word 'zusammen' meaning 'together'

> ③ E Isomer: Higher-priority substituent is on the opposite side as trans, derived from the German word 'entgegen' meaning 'opposite'

> ④ Imine (E) and (Z) can be determined, and unshared electron pairs are considered as the lowest priority

⑶ Re, Si Nomenclature

> ① Determine the priority of three substituents bonded to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbons

> ② Re-face: The face where the order of the substituents is clockwise. 

> ③ Si-face: The face where the order of the substituents is counterclockwise.

## **3. Mirror-Image Isomers**

⑴ **RS Nomenclature**: A naming convention to distinguish mirror-image isomers. (Note: A problem to be solved extensively in organic chemistry)

> ① RS nomenclature is an absolute configuration naming convention

>> ○ Absolute configuration

>> ○ Relative configuration: The experimental relationship that designates whether two configurations are identical even if the absolute configuration is not known

> ② Basic principles

>> ○ Priority rules are the same as E-Z isomers

>> ○ With atom 4 placed in the rear, if the sequence of atoms 1, 2, 3 is clockwise, it's labeled R; if counterclockwise, it's labeled S. 

>> ○ R isomer: Derived from 'rectus,' meaning clockwise

>> ○ S isomer: Derived from 'sinister,' meaning counterclockwise

> ③ Author's suggested principle: Determining RS should take no more than **0.5 seconds**.

>> ○ **Formula 1:** If "Vector 1 × Vector 4 = Vector 2," then it's S

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/ccea2877-d39c-4d36-b05a-df24e09f9245)

**Figure 11.** RS determination using **Formula 1**

As the cross product points outward, it's R

<br>

>> ○ **Formula 2:** If "Vector 1 × Vector 2 = Vector 3," then it's S

>> ○ **Formula 3:** If "Vector 3 × Vector 4 = Vector 1," then it's S: Often seen in cases where methyl is on 3 and hydrogen is on 4

>> ○ **Explanation of Formula 1:** Absolute configuration is S if the cross product direction of vector 1 and vector 4, with the central carbon as the origin, is 2

>> ○ Memorize it as special since it's S.

>> ○ The cross product doesn't perfectly align with the vertices of a regular tetrahedron due to the orthogonal vector nature

>> ○ [Proof of the author's suggested principle](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2387)

⑵ Chiral Molecules

> ① Chiral: Molecules capable of having mirror-image isomers

>> ○ Chiral comes from the word 'hand'

>> ○ Achiral: Antonym of chiral

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/be334908-2133-4611-ac2f-45c410997639)

**Figure 12.** Examples of chiral molecules

<br>

> ② Presence of internal mirror planes (mirror plane, plane of symmetry): If no internal mirror plane exists, the molecule is chiral, otherwise achiral

> ③ Uniqueness of the mirror plane: Regardless of how the mirror plane is chosen, a molecule that can be superimposed onto its mirror image is eventually determined

> ④ Examples: Chiral pharmaceuticals are about 60% available in the market

>> ○ (_R_)-Limonene is orange-scented ↔︎ (_S_)-Limonene is lemon-scented

>> ○ (_S_)-Asp-(_S_)-PheOMe is very sweet, used in Coca-Cola ↔︎ (_R_)-Asp-(_R_)-PheOMe is used extensively

>> ○ (_S_)-Thalidomide is used for morning sickness ↔︎ (_R_)-Thalidomide induces deformities

>> ○ (_S_)-Ketamine is an anesthetic ↔︎ (_R_)-Ketamine is a hallucinogen

>> ○ (_S_)-Penicillamine is used for rheumatoid arthritis ↔︎ (_R_)-Penicillamine induces mutations

⑶ Stereogenic Center: The atom that becomes a stereoisomer when its two substituents are interchanged

> ① Chiral Center: The atom that becomes a mirror-image isomer when its two substituents are interchanged

>> ○ Principle: The central atom must have different substituents (e.g., C, N, O, P, S, Si)

>> ○ Chiral centers are typically sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized.

>> ○ Unshared electron pairs are also considered as substituents

> ② Chiral centers can create chirality but not all compounds with chiral centers are chiral compounds

>> ○ Example: Mesocompounds, amine inversion, etc.

> ③ Stereogenic center refers to both chiral centers and geometric centers

⑷ Criteria for Chirality Determination

> ① No stereogenic centers: Achiral (Exception: ⑹)

> ② One stereogenic center: Chiral

> ③ Two or more stereogenic centers: Chiral determination based on internal symmetry planes

⑸ Chirality of Heteroatoms

> ① Natural occurrence noise: 80 kJ/mol

> ② Nitrogen inversion in amines: 25 kJ/mol

>> ○ In the case of secondary and tertiary amines, chiral analysis can include non-shared electron pairs, similar to a chiral center.

>> ○ Nitrogen inversion occurs very easily at room temperature and does not exhibit chirality.

>> ○ Chirality arises when there is an increase in energy difference due to torsional strain, angle strain, etc., in nitrogen inversion.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/ac44f429-b62b-41ce-a648-38948d95231b)

**Figure 13.** Nitrogen inversion

<br>

>> ○ Counterexample: 1,2,2-trimethylaziridine (18.5 kcal/mol)

>>> ○ In this case, it exhibits optical activity.

>>> ○ Reason: Due to the ring strain of cyclopropane, the energy instability is significant.

>>> ○ Nitrogen inversion occurs in heterocyclic amine compounds with rings other than three-membered rings, such as four-membered and five-membered rings.

> ③ Sulfides, sulfoniums, phosphines, phosphine oxides

>> ○ Consider electron transfer from P=O, S=O, to form P<sup>+</sup>-O<sup>-</sup>, S<sup>+</sup>-O<sup>-</sup>.

>> ○ Chirality arises due to large energy barriers.

⑹ Chirality in compounds without a chiral center

> ① Allen

>> ○ Example: H(CH<sub>3</sub>)C=C=C(CH<sub>3</sub>)H, 4-chloropenta-2,3-dien-2-ol

> ② Cycloalkenes

>> ○ Planar chirality

>> ○ Example: trans-cyclooctene

> ③ Helicenes

>> ○ Example: phenanthro[3,4-c]phenanthrene

> ④ Atropisomers

>> ○ Chirality arises due to steric repulsion.

>> ○ Rotation can occur in high-temperature environments.

>> ○ Example: BINAP

⑺ DL nomenclature: Commonly used in living organisms

> ① Definition: If (+) polarization is observed in polarimetry, it's the D enantiomer, and if (-) polarization is observed, it's the L enantiomer.

>> ○ (+) is referred to as dextrorotatory, and (-) is referred to as levorotatory.

<br>

**Figure 15.** Nomenclature of amino acids and LD

<br>

>> ○ D isomer: etymology is derived from 'textrorotory'

>> ○ L isomer: etymology is derived from 'levorotory

> ② The LD nomenclature doesn't provide any information about the RS nomenclature.

>> ○ Example: (_S_)-(+)-lactic acid, (_S_)-(-)-lactate

> ③ Monosaccharides in living organisms are typically D enantiomers, while amino acids are L enantiomers.

>> ○ Glucose, derived furthest from CHO, is classified as L-form or D-form based on the furthest carbon's chiral structure.

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Optical activity (chirality)** 

⑴ Enantiomers related by a mirror plane have identical physical and chemical properties (melting point, boiling point, solubility, etc.).

⑵ Plane-polarized light

> ① Light vibrates in all directions perpendicular to its propagation direction, but only in one direction in plane-polarized light.

> ② Passing through a polarizing prism (Nicol prism) aligns the vibrations in the same direction.

⑶ Polarimeter: Device that allows plane-polarized light to pass through a sample containing organic compounds.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/af98c1e2-1971-491f-bff5-658211b63439)

**Figure 16.** Polarimeter

<br>

⑷ Optical activity

> ① Achiral molecules do not rotate plane-polarized light.

> ② Chiral molecules rotate plane-polarized light, resulting in optical activity.

> ③ Enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions.

⑸ Specific rotation: The inherent property of each chiral molecule

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/d6b1e929-2459-4f3d-877b-ec6ae5cff199)

<br>

> ① Usually measured at 25°C.

> ② α: Specific rotation measured using a polarimeter, αD indicates the use of the D line of Na lamp.

> ③ λ: Wavelength of light, typically using the D line of sodium vapor lamp (589.3 nm).

> ④ l: Length of the sample tube (unit: dm = 10 cm).

> ⑤ c: Concentration of chiral sample (g/ml).

> ⑥ LD enantiomers

>> ○ (+) for dextrorotatory, (-) for levorotatory.

>> ○ D enantiomer: Rotates the plane of polarized light to the right.

>> ○ L enantiomer: Rotates the plane of polarized light to the left.

>> ○ Commonly, amino acids from living organisms are L-enantiomers, and sugars are D-enantiomers.

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Mesocompounds and racemic mixtures**

⑴ Maximum number of stereoisomers for a chiral center with n substituents is N.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/418b2176-6f26-47b0-9068-deed9435ea0a)

<br>

⑵ Mesocompound

>> ① Definition: A compound with more than two substituents having a molecular internal symmetry plane, making it identical to its mirror image.

>> ② Depending on the context, mesocompound can refer to a compound with more than two chiral centers.

>> ③ **Tip:** (R, S) is possible for mesocompounds, but (R, R) and (S, S) are not.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/bb144b46-0d68-4bc1-a460-b2888d9d6612)

**Figure 17.** Example of mesocompound determination

<br>

>> ○ (A) ≠ (B) ≠ (C) ≠ (D), but (a) = (d) ≠ (b) ≠ (c) holds true.

>> ○ Relationship of (A), (B), (C), (D): Optical enantiomers.

>> ○ Relationship of (b), (c): Optical enantiomers.

>> ○ Relationship of (a), (d): Mesocompound.

> ③ **Tip:** If a compound has an odd number of chiral centers greater than 2, it's not a mesocompound because it must have chirality.

>> ○ Note that although the third carbon in 2,3,4-tribromo-pentane is a chiral center, it's not a chiral center due to mesocompound rules.

⑶ Racemic mixture: The origin of this word is the Latin "racemus," meaning "cluster of grapes."

> ① Definition: A mixture of enantiomers in a 1:1 ratio.

> ② Optical activity: Equal amounts of enantiomers cancel out, resulting in an optical purity of 0.

> ③ Difference from mesocompounds: Mesocompounds consist of a single substance, while racemic mixtures are mixtures.

> ④ Natural and laboratory settings

>> ○ In nature, enzymes yield only one enantiomer of a chiral molecule.

>> ○ Example: Lactic dehydrogenase converts (+) lactic acid exclusively to pyruvic acid.

>> ○ Example: Fumarase allows water molecules to approach from only one side.

>> ○ Administering mirror-image enantiomers of natural chiral molecules to organisms can be risky.

>> ○ Certain reactions in the laboratory produce racemic mixtures, reducing purity and increasing harm potential.

> ⑤ Racemization: Reaction producing racemic mixture

>> ○ Reaction where a non-chiral molecule (reactant) reacts to form a chiral molecule (product)

>> ○ Reaction producing chiral molecules through an achiral intermediate

>> ○ Multistep reactions can lead to racemization if condition 2) is met, even if the reactant is chiral.

> ⑥ Enantiomer excess (ee)

>> ○ Enantiomer excess ee(%) = Percentage of enantiomer A - Percentage of enantiomer B

>> ○ Mixture optical rotation = Inherent optical rotation × Enantiomer excess (%)

>> ○ If A is 60% and B is 40%, ee(%) = 60 - 40 = 20% ee, indicating that A exists 20% more than B.

> ⑦ Optical purity

>> ○ Definition: Ratio of pure enantiomer's optical rotation to mixture's optical rotation

>> ○ Optical purity = Inherent optical rotation × Optical isomer ee%

>> ○ A racemic mixture of equal amounts of A and B has an optical purity of 0.

> ⑧ Separation of racemic mixtures

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Chiral-specific acid/base reactions, enzymatic reactions create chiral molecules as (R, R) or (R, S) forms.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Liquid chromatography (LC), recrystallization, fractional distillation for separation.

>> ○ Examples

>>> ○ Treating acetic anhydride with (_R_)-alanine and (_S_)-alanine produces (_R_)-N-acetylanaline and (_S_)-N-acetylanaline, respectively.

>>> ○ Subsequent treatment with acylase results in hydrolysis of (_S_)-N-acetylanaline's amide bond, while ( _R_ )-N-acetylanaline remains, allowing separation based on functional group differences.

## **6. [Chelate Isomers](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1354)**

⑴ **Type 1.** Geometric isomers: _cis_ / _trans_ isomers, _fac_ / _mer_ isomers, etc.

⑵ **Type 1-1.** _cis_ / _trans_ isomers: _cis_ if two substituents are on the same side, _trans_ if they are on opposite sides.

⑶ **Type 1-2.** _fac_ / _mer_ isomers

> ① _fac_ isomers

>> ○ When three substituents are mutually orthogonal.

>> ○ _fac_ comes from "facial," imagining a plane where the three substituents are orthogonal.

> ② _mer_ isomers

>> ○ When a pair of substituents is across from each other.

>> ○ _mer_ comes from "meridional," where a pair of substituents forms a meridional plane.

⑷ **Type 2.** Optical isomers (enantiomers)

⑸ **Example 1.** FeCl<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub> (ferric chloride) exists as fac/mer isomers. Since there's a molecular symmetry plane, there are no optical enantiomers.

<br>

⑴ According to the Bürgi–Dunitz trajectory angle, BH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> attacks the carbonyl carbon's π* at an angle of approximately 107 degrees. 

⑵ Since the two phenyl groups are not on the same plane, BH<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> experiences significant repulsion when approaching via this pathway.
