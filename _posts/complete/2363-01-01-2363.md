## **1.** Which pair of a compound's structure and its IUPAC name is _incorrectly_ matched?

⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/7b517101-b93b-450b-93d8-9a3777d2c036)

<br>

⑵ Solution **:** ④

> ① [Naming of Chain Alkenes and Alkanes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357), [Naming of Alcohols](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357) **:** Since alcohols have the highest priority, they are named so that the alcohol gets the lower number.

> ② [Naming of Cyclic Alkanes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357) **:** When there is a complex substituent, the alphabetical order of the substituent names determines their priority over the functional group.

> ③ [Naming of Bicycloalkanes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357#:-,,-\(bicycloalkane\)) **:** Number the bridgehead carbons as 1 and assign numbers following the longest path.

> ④ [Naming of Alcohols](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357) **:** The main chain should have the most carbons, so it should be -oct- not -hept-.

> ⑤ [Naming of Cyclic Alkenes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357) **:** The two carbons forming the alkene should be numbers 1 and 2, and the direction determined so that substituent numbers are as low as possible.

<br>

<br>

## **2.** Which comparison of the physicochemical properties of compounds is correct?

⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/b76c67b4-817a-4979-98fc-0f99b8e1dceb)

<br>

⑵ Solution **:** ①

> ① The angle between the C-N bonds in cyclic amines is smaller than in linear amines, increasing the vector sum of dipole moments

> ② The atomic radius of S in the 3rd period is larger than that of carbon in the 2nd period, so the ring strain in the right structure is smaller

> ③ The right structure has weaker bonds due to steric hindrance, leading to lower C-C bond dissociation energy compared to the left

> ④ Boiling points are influenced by molecular attractions, while melting points are more affected by lattice energy (≒ intermolecular overlap). Thus, cyclic hydrocarbons with alkenes have lower melting points due to decreased lattice energy, as seen with n-hexane and (E) hex-2-ene ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:-,,-1))

> ⑤ The left structure has less steric hindrance, facilitating molecular interactions and leading to a higher boiling point

<br>

<br>

## **3.** Which comparison of the reaction rate or selectivity of compounds in each reaction is _incorrect_?

⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/f5f745b9-557a-4b53-b0ae-c8441855e564)

<br>

⑵ Solution **:** ③

> ① [Comparison of Leaving Group Reaction Rates](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359) **:** TfO- > TsO- > MsO- > I- > Br- > Cl- > H2O ≫ F- > OH- > OR- > NH2-. The right structure is similar to MsOMe, showing that TfO-, TsO-, MsO- are known as good leaving groups

> ② [Solvent Conditions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359) **:** H2O stabilizes the carbocation better due to more hydrogen bonds

> ③ [Friedel-Crafts Alkylation Reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370#:5.-,,-\(FriedelCraftsalkylation) **:** Consider Cl-C-Ph-R → +C-Ph-R, then think of it as undergoing electrophilic addition to the aromatic ring. The position of the -R group does not host the carbocation, so -Cl only induces an electron-withdrawing effect without resonance stabilization due to electronegativity. Thus, the reaction rate decreases compared to when -H is present.

> ④ [Halogen Addition Reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:12.-,%98,-anti) involves the formation of a halonium ion intermediate, where Br- adds in a SN1-like manner to form dibromo alkane. This addition step is the rate-determining step (rds). The semi-carbocation is secondary on the left and tertiary on the right, making it more stable and faster to react.

> ⑤ With _tert_ -BuOK, steric hindrance increases stereoselectivity, leading to nucleophilic attack on the less hindered side

<br>

<br>

## **4.** Which pairing of structures for main products **A** and **B** is correct? (Note: Main products are obtained through appropriate separation and purification processes.)

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/2837fbec-3730-4049-b78c-2024cce0dc34)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ①

> ○ **A.** [Ozonolysis](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:-,,-\(ozonolysis\)). Splits the double bond and connects each end with a carbonyl group (=O). Considering the stereoarrangement, corresponds to structure A in ①, ②

> ○ **B.** Reaction Overview

>> ○ The orientation of the hexagonal ring is determined by the alkenyl group

>> ○ [Hydroboration-Oxidation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:23.-,,-\(hydroborationoxidation) **:** _anti_ -Markovnikov (i.e., addition of hydrogen to the less substituted side of the alkene), _syn_ -addition

>> ○ Reactions proceed faster with less substituted alkenes due to lower steric hindrance, starting with secondary alkenes

>> ○ There's little difference in steric hindrance depending on the direction of the reaction, but stereo-selectivity arises from the energy level differences of the products

<br>

<br>

<br>

## **5.** When intending to synthesize the final main product B from starting material A through multi-step reactions, which reagents are most appropriate for steps ㈎ to ㈒? (Note: Main products are obtained through appropriate separation and purification processes.)

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/dd40741a-f271-4933-84b6-39d8e2450d59)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ③

> ○ ㈎ NBS, H2O results in [halohydrin](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:13.-,% B0,-\() formation

> ○ ㈏ PPh3 is used for [ylide reagent](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1377#:-,,-\(ylidereagent\))
preparation in Wittig reaction

> ○ ㈐ [Alkane Method](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363)

> ○ ㈑ [Alkane Acid-Base Reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:3.-,,-) \+ [S<sub>N</sub> Reaction on Ketone Carbon](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1361)

> ○ ㈒ [Alkane_anti_-Addition Reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:-,anti,-Figure.51)

<br>

<br>

## **6.** Which pairing of structures for main products A and B is correct? (Note: Main products are obtained through appropriate separation and purification processes.)

⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/a48b40c6-4d27-4425-8bac-2529d378ba7d)

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/78846c11-0279-439e-b21f-ae6dd62af5b9)

<br>

⑵ Solution **:** ②

> ○ **A.** [Acid-Catalyzed Alkene
Hydration](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:-,,-Markovnikov) follows the Markovnikov rule. H+ adds to allow carbocation formation at the most stabilized position by the alkene. Then [tautomerization](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1382#:-,,-Figure.5.) occurs. Thus, a structure with a ketone and alkene attached is required (②, ③, ④)

> ○ **B.** In competitions between alkene and alkane, the alkene reacts first ([ref](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:)) ( **∵** the halonium ion intermediate formed by addition to the alkane is too unstable to proceed well)

<br>

<br>

## **7.** Which compounds have the carbon marked with an asterisk (*) as a chiral center?

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/df34e9f9-8d9f-4a4d-bb2b-1dcd1b513b13)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ⑤

> ① Since the carbon is on a plane of symmetry within the molecule, it is not a chiral center

> ② The carbon is a pivot that allows the epoxide to rotate like a top, hence it is not a chiral center

> ③ Since the carbon is on a plane of symmetry within the molecule (i.e., the plane containing two carbons attached to an alcohol), it is not a chiral center

> ④ The two carbons attached to an alcohol are symmetrical to each other, hence not chiral centers

<br>

<br>

## **8.** Which of the following is the most appropriate structure for the final major product of each reaction? (Note, the major product is obtained through appropriate separation and purification processes.)

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/a059a597-d045-4895-8748-e3a00deb3b5e)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ③

> ① Addition of halogen to alkene + S<sub>N</sub> reaction (cf. Et3N prefers S<sub>N</sub> [nucleophile](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1361#:-,,-))

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/0baaf5c0-baa5-4164-9aef-8c6e88a3be2c)

<br>

> ② Hydrogen and _i_-Pr determine the stereo-orientation of the compound, with the orientation being less hindered the further away from _i_-Pr and above rather than below

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/6eb81a25-d61f-439d-894c-4ce025e759e7)

<br>

> ③ The acid-base reaction occurs most rapidly, hence leading to an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub> reaction quickly

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/eb7f0d6c-712d-4b8a-8c99-d4d4a05d743e)

<br>

> ④ After a carbocation forms on the side that can resonate with the ketone, Br- approaches considering steric hindrance

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/b9e4b30a-7e9e-4c44-a07c-a8fbb9b8576f)

<br>

> ⑤ Two main products are possible, but the direction towards forming a conjugated alkene is more stable and thus the main product

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/21f27a4d-99a0-44aa-81ba-b0bf53d9728a)

<br>

<br>

## **9.** Which of the following is _not_ the most appropriate structure for the main product of each reaction? (Note, the main product is obtained through appropriate separation and purification processes.)

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/b136c0fa-ba45-4ddb-89bd-583c299b753b)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ②

> ① Since -NO<sub>2</sub> is the strongest EWG in the molecule, a reaction that generates a negative charge on the carbon substituted by -NO<sub>2</sub> is preferred. Thus, F- can decide on which of the two Cl positions to substitute

> ② While -NO<sub>2</sub> being the strongest EWG means a reaction generating a negative charge on the substituted carbon by -NO<sub>2</sub> is preferred, the substitution by F is correct, but an amine group is a stronger electron donor than an alkoxy group, hence the -NH-CH2-CH2-OH group moves as the substituent

> ③ Considering steric hindrance, the middle -Br or -F group will not be substituted

> ⑤ Two main considerations:

>> ○ [Multiple substitution effect](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370): Given two benzene structures, with -NH2 (strong activating substituent), -Me (weak activating substituent), -Cl (weak deactivating substituent), -NO<sub>2</sub> (strong deactivating substituent) on one benzene and -OH (strong activating substituent), -NH2 (strong activating substituent), -NO<sub>2</sub> (strong deactivating substituent) on the other, the latter is more reactive, thus acting as the electron donor for the reaction

>> ○ In the latter benzene ring, although -NH2 is a better electron donor than -OH, the strong EWG -NO<sub>2</sub> leads to carbocation formation near -NH2, hence -OH acts as the electron donor for the reaction

<br>

<br>

## **10.** Which of the following correctly pairs the structure of the main products **A** and **B**? (Note, the main product is obtained through appropriate separation and purification processes.)

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ④

> ○ A **:** TsOH acts as an acid. The acid-catalyzed epoxide opening reaction occurs in the least sterically hindered orientation

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/45e3952d-163d-439e-bac4-b0cfecc8362d)

## **11.** The following describes the synthesis of main product **B** from reactant **A**, including the 〈reaction formula〉 and 〈experimental process〉. The most _inappropriate_ description is:

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/322b447a-718d-453e-9804-4bf79d823fdf)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ②

> ① [Friedel-Craft acylation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370#:-,,-\(acyl%20group\))

> ② AlCl<sub>3</sub> acts as a catalyst. Heating oxolane-2,5-dione ( **A** ; 100 g/ml) and 4-oxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid ( **B** ; 178 g/ml) induces decarboxylation from esters or carboxylic acids

> ③ Since the boiling point of benzene is 80.1 ℃, benzene can be distilled from a mixture with water through [fractional distillation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1444#:-,,-)

> ④ Adding a base, the carboxylic acid dissolves as carboxylate (i.e., R-CO2Na)

> ⑤ Yield = 0.28 mol / (35 g × 1 mol / 100 g) × 100 = 80 (%)

## **12.** The following describes the halogenation reaction between reactants **A** and **B**. The correct explanations as per the options are:

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/3fd8c983-d022-4265-b607-e986533ab77a)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ⑦

> ○ ㄱ. The reactivity ratio is the ratio of amount produced to the number of reaction possibilities. There are 6 primary hydrogens and 4 secondary hydrogens, hence the reactivity ratio is 70 / 4 **:** 30 / 6 = 17.5 **:** 5 = 3.5 **:** 1.

> ○ ㄴ. 26 / 10 = 2.6

> ○ ㄷ. As the actual production ratio shows, the radical intermediate becomes relatively more stable the further it forms from the EWG -Cl group, hence increasing the speed of formation

<br>

<br>

## **13.** The following describes the synthesis process from starting material **A** to main products **B** ~ **D**. (Note, the main product is obtained through appropriate separation and purification processes.) The correct explanations as per the options are:

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ①

> ○ ㄱ. [Unsaturation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1356) refers to how many rings or double bonds need to be broken to convert a molecule into a linear structure

> ○ ㄴ. [Hydroboration-oxidation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:23.-,,-\(hydroborationoxidation)) considers steric hindrance to add -H and -OH groups in a syn-addition (here, 9-BBN approaches in a less hindered 5-membered ring orientation, determining the orientation of the -OH group). Followed by [Pd/C hydrogenation reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:4.-,Pd/C,-Pt/O2). The number of chiral centers (*) in **B** is 4

<br>

> ○ ㄷ. **D** is produced from the hydrogenation of an alkene, with the alkene being on the _t_-Bu side ( **∵** the hydrogenation reaction occurs on the less hindered side). **C** is produced from an [E2 elimination reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1361), with the alkene being on the opposite side to _t_-Bu

<br>

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ⑥

> ○ ㄱ. Initially, a [halonium ion intermediate](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:-, ,- ) is formed, avoiding steric hindrance and causing stereoselectivity

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/5d02ccf1-4b4e-4ce2-83ff-2a0e363afb85)

<br>

> ○ ㄴ. [Epoxidation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:-,,-RCO) (considering steric hindrance) → two S<sub>N</sub> reactions

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/8c5dae24-a609-44c5-9889-acb2e76387a4)

<br>

> ○ ㄷ. [Alkene halohydrin formation reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:13.-,%B0,-\() (-CO2Me group forms a plane with the six-membered ring, thus reducing steric hindrance) → conducts an intramolecular S<sub>N</sub> reaction

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/4b9eb278-ac12-4834-9577-a2ca869e0901)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ②

> ○ [RS nomenclature and vector cross product](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2387)

> ○ ㄱ. Enantiomers

> ○ ㄴ. Diastereomers

> ○ ㄷ. Nitrogen inversion does not consider the stereo arrangement of amines. The stereo arrangements of the two compounds are completely identical

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/4a058661-1639-454e-be09-26dca3b5a902)

<br>

<br>

## **16.** The following are the structures of heterocyclic compounds **A** to **C**. Which of the following statements are correct?

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/dfde7cd1-12a3-407b-b33c-0b9831c4ac95)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ④

> ○ ㄱ. [Aromaticity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370)

> ○ ㄴ. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen at position 1 does not participate in resonance and thus does not act as a base. Conversely, the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen at position 3 can act as a base, donating electrons to a proton.

> ○ ㄷ. The basicity order of 1H-imidazole (**A**), 1,3-oxazole (**B**), and 1,3-thiazole (**C**) is as follows. In the case of 1H-imidazole, the nitrogen at position 1 acts as a very good EDG, moving electrons to the nitrogen at position 3 through electron resonance effect, increasing its basicity. On the other hand, when comparing 1,3-oxazole and 1,3-thiazole, sulfur (S), having a larger atomic radius, contributes more to electron resonance effect than oxygen (O) (**∵** lowering the positive charge density on the carbocation, making it less unstable), making 1,3-thiazole more basic than 1,3-oxazole.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/f26def8c-912d-405b-83e3-78f5be6c0a95)

<br>

<br>

## **17.** The following are the structures of natural products **A** and **B**. Which of the following statements are correct?

 ⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/cb7645a4-662c-45ed-80e1-6821f5ae9cbb)

<br>

 ⑵ Solution **:** ⑦

> ○ ㄱ. The C-C bonds connecting the segolene compounds in **A** can rotate freely, so the plane bisecting these bonds is a plane of symmetry.

> ○ ㄴ. **A** is not optically active, while **B** is optically active. Thus, they are diastereomers.

> ○ ㄷ. Correct explanation (However, the next number follows the [CIP rule](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1358#:\(-,CIPrule,-CahnIngoldPrelog))

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/e996a3ca-7cb7-4940-bd42-808e73a3fced)

<br>

<br>

## **18.** Only select the structures of the main products that are correct from the options. (Note: The main products are obtained through appropriate separation and purification processes.)

⑴ Problem

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/6ac90258-0627-4070-98da-1ee7c9b1196d)

<br>

⑵ Solution **:** ⑤

> ○ ㄱ. The addition of NBS, NIS can be considered similar to bromination in [EAS](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370). It's a question of which position on the alkene the electrophile substitutes, as in the problem above, so that the carbocation intermediate can be stabilized by the electron-donating resonance effect of the amine group.

> ○ ㄴ. The -Br group must substitute where the carbocation intermediate is stabilized by the strong EDG, -OMe group.

> ○ ㄷ. The issue is which aromatic carbon in the pyrrole ring to substitute with an -I group. As in the problem above, it must proceed so that the carbocation intermediate can be stabilized by the electron-donating resonance effect of the amine group. If the -I group is substituted at a different position (as shown below), it cannot be assumed that the pyridine ring would break just to provide resonance stabilization.

> ○ ㄴ. It is presumed that HClO4 attaches to the oxygen of the C=O bond, and two -OH groups attack the ketone carbon, removing one oxygen followed by a concerted reaction caused by heat.

> ○ ㄷ. [Reverse reaction of tautomerization](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1382#:-,,- ). A 1,2-methyl shift also occurs.

> ○ ㄴ. [Hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:23.-,,-\(hydroborationoxidation)). The -OH group substitutes on the side with less steric hindrance. If there were no substituents on the

 hetero ring, the -OH group would be correct on the oxygen side, but since there is a very large substituent, the -OH group must substitute as far away from that substituent as possible.

> ○ㄷ. [Alcohol protection reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1372#:21.-,%98,-) preferentially occurs with primary alcohols that have less steric hindrance.
