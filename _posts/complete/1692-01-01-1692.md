>> ○ Changes in the starting date of submissionApplication Criteria + Phase 2 Retroactive

>> ○ If the priority is not claimed when applying for a change, it will only be retroactive to the first stage.

> ② Application for claiming domestic priority

> ③ International application for PCT

>> ○ PCT international application can be applied for change under domestic law as a utility model.

>> ○ In the above case, it can be done after payment of the translation and fees (Article 209)

## **6. Treaty Priority System **

#### ⑴ Definition

> ① A system that retrospects the date of application when a person who has filed an application with an ally of the Paris Treaty applies to another ally and claims priority.

#### ⑵ Purpose

> ① Foreign applications cause time, regional, cost, and legal difficulties

> ② To protect the status of prior applications internationally

#### ⑶ Priority

> ① Priority may be subject to transfer

> ② Priority rights recognized by the first applicant

> ③ Priority can be waived.

> ④ Priority loses its independence once exercised

> ⑤ Priority will be the same as the application.

#### ⑷ Subjective Requirements

> ① Allied citizens, quasi-aligned citizens

>> ○ Quasi-aligned citizens **:** non-aligned citizens who have an address or office in the allied country.

> ② Applicant or legitimate successor of the basic priority application.

> ③ In case of joint application, the procedure can be carried out independently.

>> ○ Differentiated from other special applications

>> ○ It is believed that the application itself and the application may be frustrated if a person who is not an ally or a quasi-aligned citizen are included.

> ④ No special authorization required for voluntary representative

#### ⑸ object requirement

> ① normality of first country applications

>> ○ The first country application must be recognized as a regular application in that country.

>> ○ Once a regular application is approved, the application is invalid, withdrawn, cancelled, or rejected, but it does not affect **:** the continuity of the application is not required.

>> ○ If the first country application is rejected, it cannot be the basis for the treaty priority.

>> ○ Applications that do not include the scope of claims are also recognized as regular applications under the grace period for listing the scope of claims.

> ② The earlist Applications in the First Country

>> ○ Based on the earlist application date in the case where the earlist application in country 1 has been re-applied, divided application, or changed application.

> ② Same content of application

>> ○ The second country application must be included in the first country application.

#### ⑹ Periodic Requirements

> ① <u>Patent application date, utility model registration application date ≤ the earlist application date +12 months</u>

> ② <u>Application Disclosure Date = The Earlist Application Date + 1 year and 6 months</u>

> ③ <u>Design registration application date, trademark registration application date ≤ the earlist application date + 6 months</u>

> ④ Patent and utility model require sufficient time due to the translation period of the specification.

#### ⑺ Procedural requirements

> ① Claim of priority at the time of application

>> ○ If the applicant of the original application and the applicant of the latter application are not the same, the claim of priority will not be recognized even if it is agreed later.

>> ○ The right to claim the priority of the treaty may be transferred to different successors.

> ② Submission of priority certificate

>> ○ <u>Submission date ≤ Top priority date + 1 year and 4 months</u>

>> ○ If you share a database, simply submit the application number (e.g., Japan, European Patent Office)

>> ○ Applications for claims for exception application must also be submitted.

>> ○ Calculated as the top priority in case there are more than one prior application.

>> ○ Translation of priority certificate: Not mandatory submission.The Commissioner of the Korean Intellectual Property Office may order a period of two months to be submitted for examination.

> ③ amendment or addition of priority claims

>> ○ Subjective Requirement: Person who has claimed priority

>> ○ Timing Requirements **:** <u>Correction/Additional Date ≤ Top priority date + 1 year and 4 months</u>

>> ○ Addition of priority claim: There is practical benefit in resolving the prohibition of double priority claim application.

>> ○ 1 year and 4 month is also the due date of filing date.You just have to memorize it in a related way.

> ④ special case for divisional application

>> ○ Priority certificate can be submitted within 3 months after the top priority date + 1 year and 4 months after the application date.

>> ○ After the revision in 2013, the divisional application date + the top priority date after March + the top priority date when April arrives + the documents can be submitted by April 1 year.

<br> 

#### ⑻ Effect

> ① Principle **:** Editionshort-term retrospectiveOnly for certain matters such as patent requirements, the timing of judgment is retroactive, not the actual filing date.

>> ○ Time to judge the principle of prior origin

>> ○ Time to determine pre-use rights

>> ○ Time to determine the relationship between use and conflict

>> ○ Dual retroactive when applying for division or change

>> ○ Application Disclosure

> ② **Exception 1.** Starting date of request for examination **:** <u>Date of request for examination 후 date of subsequent application + 3 years</u>

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Application period for examination is too short based on the date of application.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Lead claims are made at once. However, there are several basic applications, and each may have a different filing date.

>> ○ In the divisional application, the date of request for examination in the change application shall be based on the date of the previous application.

> ③ **Exception 2.** Period for submitting certificate of application for claim of exception to public notice

>> ○ **Point 1.** If there is an application for priority claim for more than 12 months from the date of announcement, it cannot be applied exceptions to the announcement.

>> ○ **Point 2.** Since the priority claim application is a separate application, the notice exceptional document must be submitted again within 30 days from the date of the priority claim application.

>> ○ In the case of an application for domestic priority claim, if there is an earlier application for the application of a notice exception within 12 months, the effect of the notice exception claim is also recognized in the priority claim application at the time of the claim.

>> ○ Reasons for the difference: Whether there is a principle of territorial principle.

> ④ **Exception 3.** Criteria for the expiration date of the period of existence **:** Based on the date of application in Korea (**∵** territorial principles)

>> ○ **Reason 1.** The most important reason called retrospective of the time of judgment, not the date of application, is considered to be due to the duration.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Because there should be no disadvantages in using the priority system.

> ⑤ **Exception 4.** Requirements for non-performance or insufficient implementation of non-performance rights by finance (**∵** If the date of application for election is the standard, too many non-performance people will be included)

>> ○ <u>Application date ≥ max (Application date + 4 years, registration date + 3 years)</u>

>> ○ Reason **:** Since the implementation is limited to Korea, it is reasonable to base the non-execution or insufficient implementation on the date of subsequent application according to the principle of territorial principle.

>> ○ Without such circumstancesThe timing of the judgment in the implementation of the change application or divisional application is not implemented or insufficient.retroactive box

> ⑥ Application for treaty priority claim, divisional application, and modification application

>> ○ Permission of divisional application and amendment application to a person who claimed the treaty priority.

>> ○ Claims of treaty priority based on divisional application or alteration application are not permitted: too complicated.

>> ○ Since it is so difficult to have a priority claim, the priority claim application should be a constant, not a variable.

> ⑦ Inappropriate cases

>> ○ Only retroactive effects disappear.

>> Opartially retroactive, partially non-retroactive

#### ⑼ Application

> ① In the case of filing an application for priority claim for a part of the contents of the first country application.

> ② In the case where two or more priority claims are filed by dividing an application for one country in the first country.

> ③ In the case of filing an application for a claim of priority based on two or more applications from allies (complex priority)

>> ○ Timing Requirements **:** Second Country Application Date 최우선 Top priority date + 12 months

>> ○ Depending on the content of the claim, the same content as each previous application is determined retroactively to the date of application of the previous application.

>> ○ Contents that are not the same for any previous application are judged as the date of subsequent application.

> ④ In the case where the application for priority claim includes a portion not included in the application for country 1 (partial priority)

## **6. Domestic Priority Policy**

#### ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition **:** A pre-application → A+B post-application within 12 months → Withdrawal of pre-application and retroactive effect of post-application to the pre-application.

> ② Pre-application **:** Patent application, utility model registration application, PCT application

> ③ Post-application **:** Patent application, utility model registration application

#### ⑵ Purpose

> ① Protection of used and improved inventions

> ② Balance with treaty priority system in favor of foreigners **:** Include the invention of the previous application in one application and grant the option of subsequent application.

> ③ Revitalization of PCT application system : PCT applications and domestic priority system applications are often filed at the same time because the timing requirements are the same

#### ⑶ Principal requirements

> ① The same person as the applicant of the previous application or legitimate successor **:** It only needs to be the same at the time of application.

>> ○ According to the precedent, the person who actually succeeded is also recognized as the subject eligibility (2017F1274) **:** Different from the treaty priority.

> ② In the case of joint application, all co-owners must apply **:** Because the previous application is withdrawn.

> ③ The voluntary agent requires special authorization because the previous application is withdrawn.

#### ⑷ Objective Requirements

> ① Continuation of previous applications

>> ○ Treaty priority system does not require applications to continue.

>> ○ The prior application for which the patent decision has been finalized cannot be the basis for claiming priority.

> ② Precedent application is not a divisional application or a change application **:** Prevention of delay in examination

> ③ First country → Second country treaty priority → Domestic priority **:** Recognized as the purpose of recommending treaty priority

> ④ Post-application will be included in the earlist of the previous application.

>> ○ It is possible to claim domestic priority based on the invention that was stated in the most famous drawing of the previous application but was deleted by correction.

#### ⑸ Periodic Requirements

> ① <u>Date of post-application ≤ Date of application date + 12 months</u>

> ② <u>Date of application disclosure = Date of prior application + 1 year and 6 months</u>

> ③ All subsequent applications will be disclosed along with the earlist application.

> ④ There is no further supplementary relief procedure for the requirements of the subsequent application date.

#### ⑹ Procedural requirements

> ① The purport and the indication of the previous application at the same time as the application (Article 55 (2))

>> ○ If the applicant of the pre-application and the applicant of the post-application are not the same, the claim of priority is not recognized even if it is agreed later.

>> ○ In the case of an application that does not involve a domestic priority claim, the priority claim cannot be made.

> ② No need for proof of priority **:** The pre-application is in Korea, so it differs from the treaty priority.

> ③ Withdrawal of previous applications

>> ○ Automatic withdrawal at <u>each date of application + one year and 3 months</u> (Article 56)

>> ○ In the case where multiple pre-applications are based, each is deemed to be withdrawn when one year and three months have elapsed from the date of each pre-application.

>>> ○ In the case of disclosure of applications, all subsequent applications will be disclosed along with the earlist application.

>> ○ <u>Addition and correction date of priority claim ≤ The earlist application date + 1 year and 4 months</u> (Article 55, Paragraph 7)

>>> ○ Addition of priority claim **:** There is practical benefit in resolving the prohibition of double priority claim application.

>>> ○ Maintaining the identity of the treaty priority policy **:** The filing date of the treaty priority document is one year and four months.

>> ○ Consideration of withdrawal of domestic priority claims

>>> ○ If the application for claiming priority is withdrawn within one year and three months from the date of application, the claim for priority is considered to be withdrawn.

> ○ Prohibition of withdrawal of domestic priority claims

>> ○ Withdrawal cannot be made after <u>the date of the pre-application + 1 year and 3 months</u> because the pre-application was automatically withdrawn.

>> ○ Reason **:** Since the pre-application is already considered to be withdrawn, there is no real benefit in withdrawing the priority claim.

> ○ It is also allowed to add priority claims from <u>the date of pre-application + 1 year and 3 months to the date of pre-application + 1 year and 4 months</u>.

>> ○ Reason **:** Since the applicants first claimed priority

#### ⑺ Effects

> ① Principle **:** Retroactive to the time of judgment. Only for certain matters such as patent requirements, the timing of judgment is retroactive, not the actual filing date.

>> ○ Time point to judge the principle of the application date

>> ○ Time point to determine pre-use rights

>> ○ Time point to determine the relationship between use and conflict

> ② **Exception 1.** Date of calculation of request for examination **:** Date of request for examination ≤ Date of post-application + 3 years

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Application period for examination is too short based on the date of application.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Lead claims are made at once. However, there are several basic applications, and each may have a different filing date.

>> ○ Warning **:** In the divisional application and the application for change, the date of request for examination shall be based on the date of the pre-application

> ③ **Exception 2.** Claim for exception of notice

>> ○ **Point 1.** If there is an earlier application within 12 months from the date of a specific notice of the same invention, the effect of the exception to the notice is also recognized in the priority claim application at the time when the priority claim can be made.

>> ○ **Point 2.** Since the priority claim application is a separate application, the notice exceptional document must be submitted again within 30 days from the date of the priority claim application.

>> ○ Warning **:** In the case of an application for a treaty priority claim, if there is an post-application for claiming priority for more than 12 months from a specific notice, it is not possible to receive an exception to the notice.

>> ○ Reasons for the difference **:** Territorial principle.

> ④ **Exception 3.** Base date of expiration date of duration **:** Base date of subsequent application

>> ○ **Reason 1.** The most important reason called retrospective of the time of judgment, not retroactive to the date of application, is considered to be due to the duration.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Because there should be no disadvantages in using the priority system.

> ⑤ **Exception 4.** Requirements for non-execution or insufficient implementation of non-exclusive licenses by finance

>> ○ <u>Billing date ≥ max (Application date + 4 years, Registration date + 3 years)</u>

>> ○ Reason **:** For the unity with treaty priority

>> ○ Warning **:** A change application or divisional application without such circumstances is not implemented or the timing of judgment is retroactive in insufficient implementation.

> ⑥ Acknowledgement of the status of an expanded application

>> ○ Situation **:** 甲 A application → 乙 A application → 甲 AB subsequent application + domestic priority claim

>> ○ Withdrawal of the earlier application (A) on the date of the earlier application + one year and three months due to the claim of priority.

>> ○ Application disclosure date is <u>the pre-application date + 1 year and 6 months</u> **:** Application (A) is not disclosed. Post-application (AB) is disclosed

>> ○ 乙's application is withdrawn as an earlier application.

>> ○ The post-application not included in the pre-application will be disclosed in one year and a half, but it is not disapproved for the extended application status. 

>> ○ The post-application not included in the pre-application can be withdrawn by another application **:** Since the entire post-application may be withdrawn, deletion correction should be considered

> ⑦ Application for domestic priority claim, divisional application, and application for change application

>> ○ A divisional application for a domestic priority claim application and a change application may be filed within one year and three months from the date of application.

>> ○ Reason **:** The pre-application after the date of the first date + 1 year and 3 months will be considered withdrawn.

>> ○ Unable to file an application claiming priority based on the divisional application or the change application.

>>> ○ Reason **:** The priority claim is so difficult in that situation.

#### ⑻ Application

> ① Comprehensive priority based on domestic applications and foreign applications of the Paris Treaty Alliance

> ② If an international patent application is a basic application

>> ○ Situation **:** An international application in which the previous application is designated by the Republic of Korea and Japan, and a later application is an application for claiming priority in the Republic of Korea.

>> ○ The previous application is considered to be withdrawn at max (International filing date + March 1st base date) (Article 55, Paragraph 4).

>> ○ Since Korea is included in the designated country, it is not necessary to submit a translation (Article 3, 202 leaflet).

> ③ In the case of an international patent application is a priority claim application

>> ○ The date of international application is retroactive to the date of basic application: At this time, the date of basic application is called the priority date.

>> ○ A person who intends to claim priority may file an application.

> ④ ○ Expanded principle of prior application

>> ○ In the case where an international application is a basic application in the domestic priority system: Recognition of the original principle expanded only within the range where the scope of the international application overlaps with the scope of the priority claim application

>> ○ In the case where an international application is an application claiming priority in the domestic priority system: the recognition of the original application, the original application, and the translation of the international application only overlap

> ⑤ Cumulative domestic priority

>> ○ Situation **:** The post-application claims priority on the basis of the pre-application. The pre-application claims priority on the basis of pre-pre-application.

>> ○ Double priority (Article 55, Paragraph 3)

>>> ○ Definition **:** Invention common to pre-pre-application, pre-application, and post-application

>>> ○ Effect **:** A's retroactive effect is not recognized.

>>> ○ Reason **:** To prevent the actual extension of the priority period.

>> ○ Post-application is disclosed at the date of the pre-application + 1 year and half months 

>> ○ Disapproval of the retroactive effect of double priority is not a big problem due to the rapid disclosure of the application.

#### ⑼ Comparison of Treaty Priority System and Domestic Priority System

> ① Special Authorization

>> ○ If an ordinary voluntary agent applies for a treaty priority claim, he/she does not need to obtain special authorization.

>> ○ In the case where an ordinary voluntary agent files an application for claiming domestic priority, special authorization must be obtained.

> ② Certificate of prior application

>> ○ In the case of an application for claiming treaty priority, the certificate of prior application must be submitted.

>> ○ In the case of an application for claiming domestic priority, there is no need to submit the certificate of the previous application: because the previous application is ongoing.

> ③ Withdrawal of previous applications

>> ○ Advancement of treaty priority claims is not considered withdrawn.

>> ○ Appeal for domestic priority claims is considered withdrawn.

> ④ Application for cumulative priority claim

>> ○ In the case of an application claiming treaty priority, only one basic application with the best potential is recognized **:** Double priority is impossible.

>> ○ In the case of a domestic priority claim application, double retroactivity at the time of judgment is not recognized in the case of double priority.
