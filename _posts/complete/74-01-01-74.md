## **1\. Overview** 

⑴ Central dogma refers to the flow of genetic information (DNA → RNA → protein).

⑵ After the discovery of reverse transcriptase in retroviruses (RNA viruses), the central dogma was revised.

⑶ Information transfer relationship

> ① DNA replication: DNA → DNA

> ② Transcription: DNA → RNA

> ③ Translation: RNA → Amino acid sequence (primary structure)

> ④ Triplet code (DNA) → Codon (mRNA) → Anticodon (tRNA) → Amino acid

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Genes and Gene Expression**

⑴ Genes and Chromosomes

⑵ One gene, multiple polypeptides theory

> ① One gene, one enzyme hypothesis: Beadle and Tatum's experiment

>> ○ Inferring biosynthetic pathways using mutants: ornithine, citrulline, arginine

<br>

**Table 1.** Beads and Tatum's Experiments

<br>

>> ○ **Tip 1.** The more growing the material, the later stages of the biosynthetic pathway.

>> ○ **Tip 2.** The more a mutant grows, the earlier the step it is involved in the metabolic pathway.

> ② One gene, one protein hypothesis: Proteins that do not function as enzymes are found.

> ③ One gene, one polypeptide hypothesis: Proteins forming quaternary structures are revealed.

> ④ One gene, multiple polypeptides hypothesis: It has been revealed that multiple polypeptides can be produced from a single gene.

⑶ Regulation of gene expression

> ① Overview of gene expression

>> ○ First, the somatic cells of our body have the same DNA.

>> ○ Second, each tissue cell transcribes only specific genes, resulting in different gene expression patterns, which lead to variations in structure and function.

> ② Regulation of Transcription**  

>> ○ Regulation through transcription repression (prokaryotic cells)  

>> ○ Regulation through transcription activation (prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells)  

>> ○ Regulation through chromatin condensation: preventing RNA polymerase access (Barr bodies)  

> ③ Regulation through mRNA degradation

> ④ Regulation of Translation

> ⑤ Regulation through protein degradation (proteases)

<br>

<br>

## **3\. DNA replication**

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Untangling DNA helix

> ① Replication proceeds in both directions from the replication origin (ori) (= the replication fork moves in both directions from the replication origin)

>> ○ Replication origin: A = T rich site with weak hydrogen bonds

>> ○ Replication fork: The junction between the strand where the DNA is hydrogen-bonded and the strand that is not.

>> ○ Prokaryotes: DnaA recognizes one replication origin.

>>> ○ DnaA

>>>> ○ Consensus sequence: 9 base pairs × 4 + 13 base pairs × 3  

>>>> ○ 20-50 monomers

>>>> ○ Binds simultaneously to multiple AT-rich sites.

>>>> ○ Melts DNA by using one molecule of ATP.

>> ○ Eukaryotes: ORC (origin recognition complex) recognizes origin of replication.

>>> ○ The replication speed is slow, so there are multiple origins of replication.

>>> ○ Yeast: 250 to 400 replication origins.

>>> ○ Mammals: 25,000 origins of replication; approximately 6,500 in humans.

>>> ○ Rich in A-T sequences.

>>> ○ The unit of replication determined by the origin of replication is called a replicon.

>> ○ ARS (autonomic replicatoin sequence)

>> ○ DnaA and ORC create replication bubbles, exposing several dozen nucleotides of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).

> ② Enzyme: Helicase, DNA topoisomerase, single chain binding protein

>> ○ Helicase: Releases hydrogen bonds in two complementary strands.

>>> ○ Prokaryotes: DnaB, PcrA

>>> ○ Eukaryotes: MCM (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex)  

>>> ○ DnaB

>>>> ○ [Helicase characteristic experiment](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1468): Two conclusions can be drawn  

>>>> ○ **Conclusion 1**: Requires replication bubbles created by DnaA or ORC to bind to DNA.  
  
>>>> ○ **Conclusion 2**: Typically binds to the template of the lagging strand at the replication fork and moves in the 5' → 3' direction (exceptions exist).  

>>>> ○ ATP is used.

>>>> ○ Minimum ssDNA length for a replication bubble: 16 nucleotides or more.  
  
>>>> ○ 100 turns/second = 6,000 rpm

>>> ○ PcrA: Consists of A1, A2, B1, B2 domains, and a P-loop.  

>> ○ The helicase acts to intensify the DNA's torsion, resulting in unstable structure.

**Figure 1.** Topological isomers of circular DNA with a size of 210 bp

The second double helix has fewer nucleotides per turn (lower torsional stress), while the third double helix has more nucleotides per turn (higher torsional stress).

<br>

>>> ○ L (Linking number): The number of loops. Conserved during torsional stress calculations, with counterclockwise (+) rotation.

>>> ○ T (Twist number): The number of helical turns. DNA is inherently right-handed, so it has counterclockwise (+) torsional stress.

>>> ○ W (Writhe number): The number of supercoils.

>>> ○ Supercoil: A structure where the DNA molecule forms loops on itself, related to the enhancement or relaxation of torsional stress.

>>> ○ Positive supercoil: A left-handed supercoil (the <span style="color: red;">third</span> in the figure), with a positive writhe number.

>>> ○ Negative supercoil: A right-handed supercoil (the <span style="color: red;">second</span> in the figure), with a negative writhe number.

>>> ○ Positive supercoils form left-handed supercoils, thereby increasing the right-handed torsional stress of the double helix.  

>>> ○ Negative supercoils form right-handed supercoils, thereby relaxing the right-handed torsional stress of the double helix.

>>> ○ Most organisms that are not thermophilic bacteria have DNA with a negative supercoil structure.

>> ○ DNA topoisomerase: An enzyme that relieves torsional stress in DNA.

>>> ○ Acts at a region far ahead of the replication fork.

>>> ○ **Type 1 DNA Topoisomerase**

>>>> ○ An enzyme that cuts one strand of the DNA, allows it to unwind naturally, and then reseals it.  

>>>> ○ Strand-cutting and strand-releasing activities: Nuclease and ligase activities.  

>>>> ○ Does not require ATP.  

>>>> ○ Relieves negative supercoils in E. coli. 

>>>> ○ **Step 1.** Tyrosine attacks the phosphate backbone, creating a nick in the DNA strand.  

>>>> ○ **Step 2.** The DNA rotates one turn under torsional stress.  

>>>> ○ **Step 3.** Resealing occurs, ultimately resolving the supercoil.  

>>> ○ **Type 2 DNA Toposiomerase** (DNA gyrase)

>>>> ○ An enzyme that cuts both strands of the DNA, rotates (topologically rearranges) them, and reseals them.

>>>> ○ Converts positively supercoiled DNA molecules into negatively supercoiled forms.

>>> ○ **Single-Stranded Binding Protein**  

>>>> ○ Prokaryotes: Single-Strand Binding Protein (SSBP); a monomer with two domains.  

>>>> ○ Eukaryotes: Replication Protein A (RPA).  

>>>> ○ **Function 1.** Temporarily binds to each single strand of DNA after the hydrogen bonds are broken, preventing the strands from pairing back together.

>>>> ○ **Function 2.** Stabilizes the DNA.  

>>>> ○ **Function 3.** Protects DNA from twisting.  

>>>> ○ SSBPs are required to activate the helicase function in experimental settings.  

> ③ Prokaryotic cells: Circular DNA, one replication origin.

> ④ Eukaryotic cells: Linear DNA, multiple replication origins.

>> ○ Eukaryotic cells have larger genomes than prokaryotic cells, so they have many origins of replication.

⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Attaching primer

> ① Primer: Short RNA fragments underlying DNA polymerization

>> ○ PCR primers are DNA fragments.

>> ○ The primer is approximately 10 nucleotides in length.

> ② Primers provide the first 3'-OH group ends needed for DNA polymerization.

> ③ Enzyme: Primase is involved. Primase is responsible for synthesizing and attaching primers.  

>> ○ Since helicase operates at a speed of 100 turns/second, primase also works at a remarkably fast pace.  

>> ○ Eukaryotes: Pol α/primase complex. 

> ④ Primosome: A prepriming complex formed by several proteins before the synthesis of RNA primers.

⑶ 3<sup>rd</sup>. DNA polymerization

>>> ○ Converts sticky ends of restriction fragments to blunt ends in [DNA recombination](https://jb243.github.io/pages/77).

>>> ○ Lacks 5' → 3' exonuclease activity, so it cannot degrade the primer of template DNA.

>> ○ Collectively, DnaB and DnaG are referred to as the primosome.

>> ○ **Step 1.** E + ATP (or NAD<sup>+</sup>) → E-AMP + PPi (or NMN)  

>>> ○ Activated AMP from ATP forms a phosphoamide bond with the e-amino group of a lysine residue in DNA ligase.

**Figure 6.** rolling-circle replication

<br>

⑽ Multi-fork replication

> ① Situation: Under extremely favorable conditions, the reproduction cycle of E. coli is 20 minutes.  

> ② Question: Since the DNA replication speed is 1000 nucleotides per second, it takes longer to replicate the entire chromosome than the reproduction cycle.  

> ③ Solution: Multi-fork replication. This phenomenon allows replication to start on already replicating daughter strands, preparing for the next cell cycle before the current cycle is completed.

⑸ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Termination of the RNA chain: In the terminator sequence, RNA polymerase leaves DNA and DNA twists again.

> ① Prokaryotic Terminators

>> ○ Intrinsic Terminator: Transcription is terminated by forming a hairpin (hairpin-oligo-U structure).

>>> ○ A hairpin is formed due to an inverted repeat sequence.

>>> ○ An A-T rich site is located near the inverted repeat sequence, where U bases are transcribed using A as the template.

>>> ○ The transcription product naturally dissociates due to the unstable A=U base pair chain.

>> ○ Rho-dependent Terminator: The Rho factor acts as a DNA-RNA helicase to promote the detachment of the RNA being synthesized.

> ② Eukaryotic Terminators

>> ○ When the poly-A signal sequence (5'-AAUAAA-3') appears on the transcript, endonuclease activity is triggered.

>> ○ The endonuclease cleaves the transcript 10 to 35 nucleotides downstream, leading to its detachment.

>> ○ A poly-A tail, consisting of multiple A bases, is added to the cleaved 3' end.

⑹ 4<sup>th</sup>. mRNA processing (eukaryotic cells only): Mature mRNA moves to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore. Due to the maturity, the degradation is decreased and the translation is increased.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> generation: mCap (Cap 0) derived from yeast. The disadvantage is the lack of directionality.  

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> generation: ARCA (anti-reverse cap analog) (Cap 0 mimic) Derived from yeast. Introduces a methyl group for directionality.  

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> generation: Trinucleotide cap analog (e.g., CleanCap) (Cap 1). It is excellent because it closely resembles the 5'-cap found in vivo.

<br>

>>> ○ **Step 1.** Internal adenosine molecule attacks the 5' splice site, forming a lariat structure.  

>>> ○ **Step 2.** The 3' end of the 5' exon attacks the 3' splice site, joining the 5' exon to the 3' exon and excising the intron.  

>>> ○ In this way, the exons gradually become connected.

>> ○ **Difference 1.** Initial nucleophile: Group I uses an external guanosine molecule, while Group II uses an internal adenosine molecule.

>> ○ **Difference 2.** Structure: Group I is characterized by a complex loop and helix structure, while Group II is characterized by a lariat structure.

>> ○ **Difference 3.** Distribution  
   
>>> ○ Group I: rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA of bacteria; mitochondrial genome and chloroplast genome of lower eukaryotes; rRNA of the nuclear genome in lower eukaryotes; and some tRNA and mRNA in the chloroplast and mitochondria of higher plants.
  
>>> ○ Group II: rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA of cellular organelles in fungi, plants, and protists; mRNA of bacteria.

>>> ○ Summary: Group I is more common in lower organisms (e.g., bacteria), and Group II in higher organisms (e.g., fungi, plants).  

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. mRNA editing: Altering the RNA sequence

>> ○ Rare compared to capping, poly A tail formation, and splicing.  

>> ○ Guide RNA serves as a template.  

>> ○ **Type 1.** Protein length remains unchanged.  

>> ○ **Type 2.** Protein length changes (e.g., apolipoprotein B protein).  
  
>>> ○ In humans, apolipoprotein B protein becomes 100 kDa Apo-B100 in the liver.  

>>> ○ In humans, apolipoprotein B protein becomes 48 kDa Apo-B48 in the small intestine.  

>>> ○ Cytidine deaminase deaminates 5'-CAG-3' in RNA to 5'-UAG-3', creating a stop codon at a new position.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Alternative splicing

>> ○ Some exons on a single pre-mRNA are selectively included, forming multiple mRNA combinations.  

>> ○ >95% of intron-containing human genes undergo alternative splicing.

>> ○ **Result 1.** Improper splicing removes normal exons → May cause cancer.

>>> ○ **Alternative Promoter**  

>>> ○ **Alternative Poly-A**

**Figure 12.** Cis/Trans splicing

<br>

>> ○ **Type 1.** Cis-splicing: The process in which exons within a single pre-mRNA are joined through 5' ss (splice site) to 3' ss reactions, resulting in the formation of mRNA.
  
>> ○ **Type 2.** Trans-splicing: The process in which two different pre-mRNAs are joined into a single mRNA molecule.

>>> ○ **2-1.** The process in which the spliced leader (SL) from the 5' tss (trans splice site) is joined with the pre-mRNA at the 3' tss.

>>> ○ **2-2.** Trans-splicing between different genes

>>> ○ **2-3.** Trans-splicing within the same gene: The direction of the template may differ, or the origin may be maternal or paternal. Exon duplication is also possible.

>> ○ SL trans-splicing process
  
>>> ○ **Step 1.** The 5' tss of SL RNA binds to the 3' tss of pre-mRNA.
  
>>> ○ **Step 2.** Mature mRNA contains an SL exon and a TMG cap at the 5' end and is translated in the cytoplasm.
  
>>> ○ **Step 3.** As a result of splicing, a Y-shaped product (SL intron + pre-mRNA outron) is formed, resembling the lariat intron product generated in cis-splicing.

> ⑧ 8<sup>th</sup>. mRNA stability regulation 

>> ○ Longer mRNA lifespan enables more protein translation.  

>> ○ Prokaryotic mRNA has a lifespan of about 2 to 3 minutes.

>> ○ Eukaryotic mRNA has a lifespan ranging from several days to several weeks.

>> ○ **Example 1.** Hemoglobin mRNA remains intact and is not degraded as long as the red blood cell is alive.  

>>> ○ Globin mRNA is highly expressed in red blood cells, accounting for about two-thirds of total blood RNA.  

>> ○ **Example 2.** Transferrin: An iron-importing and transport protein.  

>>> ○ Iron Response Element (IRE): Located downstream of the coding region. An AT-rich sequence.  

>>> ○ When Fe<sup>3+</sup> increases: IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP) becomes inactive → The poly-A sequence of transferrin mRNA is removed → mRNA is degraded.  

>>> ○ When Fe<sup>3+</sup> decreases: IRE-BP becomes active → The poly-A sequence of transferrin mRNA is protected → mRNA is stabilized → Expression increases.

> ① rRNA is transcribed in the nucleolus by RNA polymerase I.  

> ② mRNA and microRNA are transcribed in the nucleoplasm by RNA polymerase II.  

> ③ tRNA is transcribed in the nucleoplasm by RNA polymerase III.  

> ④ The promoter for rRNA is located far upstream of the gene.  

> ⑤ The promoter for mRNA and microRNA is located close upstream of the gene.  

> ⑥ The promoter for tRNA is located close downstream of the gene.  

> ⑦ TBP (TATA-binding protein) is required for all.

> ① rRNA processing

>> ○ **Type 1.** 45S rDNA in the nucleolus → 18S rRNA + 5.8S rRNA + 28S rRNA

>> ○ **Type 2.** Cleaving unmethylated bases

> ② tRNA processing: Slight cleavage of 3' and 5' from pre-tRNA.

⑼ Regulation of Transcription in Prokaryotes

> ① Regulatory elements
   
>> ○ Common sequences in the promoter (P) and operator gene (O) (repressor binding site)

>> ○ Activator binding site

>>> ○ Example: E. coli cAMP-CAP (Catabolite Activator Protein) complex recognition site

> ② Operon: A mechanism for coordinated regulation by transcribing multiple genes into a single mRNA.  

> ③ Regulon: A mechanism where multiple operons are regulated by a single protein.  
 
>> ○ Example: Maltose regulon in E. coli. 

> ④ Regulation by transcription repressors 

>> ○ When a repressor binds to the operator gene, it prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter.  

>> ○ Inducible operon: In the presence of an inducer, the repressor bound to the operator is removed, allowing RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and initiate transcription.  

>>> ○ **Example 1.** Catabolic operon: Lactose operon (3 genes)

>> ○ Repressor operon: In the absence of an inducer, the repressor bound to the operator is removed, enabling RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and initiate transcription.  

>>> ○ **Example 1.** Biosynthetic operon: Tryptophan operon

> ⑤ Regulation by transcription activators

⑽ Operon: Having ORFs for several genes under one promoter / operating region and being expressed simultaneously

> ① Summary

>> ○ Inducible operon: The substance of interest finally promotes the expression of the operon.

>> ○ Repressor operon: The substance of interest finally inhibits the expression of the operon.

>> ○ Positive regulation: Regulation involving activators. In inducible operons, the activator is activated by the target molecule, while in repressor operons, the activator is inhibited by the target molecule.  

>> ○ Negative regulation: Regulation involving repressors. In inducible operons, the target molecule inhibits the repressor, while in repressor operons, the target molecule activates the repressor.

**Figure 14.** Composition of lactose operon 

<br>

>>> ○ Regulator (lac I): Sites that encode inhibitors. It is not included in the operon because it has its own promoter (constantly expressed).

>>> ○ Operating site

>>> ○ **Gene 1.** Beta-galactosidase (lac Z)

>>>> ○ β-galactosidase: Lactate lyase. Converts lactose into allolactose.

>>>> ○ lac Z actually produces the α peptide, which is the N-terminal part of β-galactosidase.

>>>> ○ α complementation: The process by which the α peptide combines with another peptide from the host to form β-galactosidase.

>>> ○ **Gene 2.** Beta-galactosid permease (lac Y): Lactose transporter. Expressed on cell membrane.

>>> ○ **Gene 3.** Beta-galactoside transacetylase (lac A)

>>>> ○ Beta-galactoside transacetylase removes by-products.

>> ○ Negative regulation of lac operon

>>> ○ The lac operon repressor can bind to the operator site.  

>>> ○ The lac operon repressor is produced by the **lac I gene** and inhibits RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter.  

>>> ○ When the lac repressor binds to allolactose, a derivative of lactose, it can no longer bind to the operator site (lactose acts as an inducer).

>> ○ Positive regulation of lac operon

>>> ○ **Background**: The promoter of the lac operon has low affinity for RNA polymerase, so transcription does not occur efficiently even in the absence of the repressor.  

>>> ○ Adenylyl cyclase (AC) converts ATP into cAMP.  

>>> ○ Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) binds to cAMP to form a complex.  

>>> ○ The CAP-cAMP complex facilitates the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter.  

>>> ○ Glucose can inhibit adenylyl cyclase through an allosteric inhibition site, preventing the above mechanism from functioning.  

>>> ○ **Result**: Glucose, being more efficient, is prioritized over the operation of the lac operon, avoiding the unnecessary synthesis of enzymes from the lac operon.  

>> ○ The lac operon provides a mechanism for diauxic growth in media containing both glucose and lactose.

>>> ○ Glucose (+), Lactose (+): cAMP decreases → Positive regulation decreases → Lactose-degrading enzymes are not produced.

>>> ○ Glucose (+), Lactose (-): cAMP decreases → Positive regulation decreases → Lactose-degrading enzymes are not produced.

>>> ○ Glucose (-), Lactose (+): Allolactose increases → Repressor binding to the operator decreases → Lactose-degrading enzymes are produced.

>>> ○ Glucose (-), Lactose (-): Allolactose decreases → Repressor binding to the operator increases → Lactose-degrading enzymes are not produced.

>> ○ Operons derived from the lac operon

>>> ○ tac operon

>>> ○ lac I<sup>-</sup>: The repressor is defective and cannot bind to the operator site, resulting in constant activation.

>>> ○ lac I<sup>S</sup>: Lactose cannot bind to the repressor, resulting in constant inactivation.

>>> ○ lac O<sup>c</sup>: The operator site is defective, preventing the repressor from binding to the operator, resulting in constant activation.

>>> ○ lac Z<sup>-</sup>: Encodes a defective lac Z gene. β-galactosidase is not expressed, regardless of operon activity.

>>> ○ ξ polypeptide, δ polypeptide, indole glycerolphosphate synthase, β polar peptide, α polar peptide, respectively.

>> ○ **Adjusting mechanism 1.** Negative control

>>> ○ The trp promoter has a relatively high binding affinity for RNA polymerase → No need for an activator protein.

>>> ○ By the regulatory gene (trpR), the trp repressor binds to trp and attaches to the operator site, acting as a corepressor.

>> ○ **Adjusting mechanism 2.** Attenuation control mechanism

>>> ○ trp mRNA has four regions that can form complementary base pairs, each located near the trp coding region.

>>> ○ Leader sequence: Translated into a protein, but unrelated to tryptophan biosynthesis.

>>> ○ The term "leader" in leader peptide simply means that it is synthesized before the tryptophan-related enzymes.

Following the poly-U sequence, trp E, D, C, B, A sequences are present.

<br>

>> ○ **Case 1.** Tryptophan is low: Even if RNA pol is transcribed up to 4 times, tryptophan tRNA is insufficient, resulting in slow translation of the trp genetic code. Far away from transcription. No implicit terminator (above)

>> ○ **Case 2.** Tryptophan rich: When RNA pol is transcribed up to 4 times, the translation speed is fast, and ribosomes are located at 1-2 sequences → 3 and 4 hairpin formation → Transcription termination

>> ○ **Case 3.** If there is no tryptophan: Even if RNA pol is transcribed up to 4 times, no ribosome bound to mRNA is found → 3 and 4 hairpin formation → Termination of transcription

>>> ○ **Example**: I-, Is from lac-derived operon

> ⑧ Recombinant Protein and Inducible Promoter

>> ○ Cells that continue to make recombinant proteins are metabolic: Cell growth inhibition, plasmid instability, decreased production yield

>> ○ Expression strategy: After raising the cell concentration to some extent, inducing substance is added to induce expression

>> ○ Conclusion: Inducible promoters that can control expression are widely used to increase production yield

⑾ Regulation of Eukaryotic Transcription

> ① Transcription factor

>> ○ Eukaryotic RNA polymerase cannot bind to promoter alone  

>> ○ Various regulatory sequences upstream of the gene (eg: RNA polymerase starts transcription when universal transcription factor and special transcription factor bind to TATA box, CAAT box)

>> ○ Universal Transcription Factor: Universally present in each cell (eg: TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, TFIIJ, etc.)

>> ○ Special Transcription Factor: Specifically present (eg: DNA-binding domain (DBD), activation domain (AD)

>> ○ Short-range control element: Promoters are near

>>> ○ **1st.** TFIID binds to the TATA box through the TBP subunit of TFIID.  

>>> ○ **2nd.** TFIIA and TFIIB stabilize the entire complex.  

>>> ○ **3rd.** TFIIF and RNAPII (RNA polymerase II) bind to the complex.  

>>>> ○ GTF is involved in recruiting RNAPII.  

>>> ○ **4th.** TFIIE and TFIIH additionally bind to the complex.  

>>>> ○ TFIIH phosphorylates the CTD (C-terminal domain) of RNAPII in the nucleus → Releases TFIID and activates helicase activity.  

>>>> ○ RNAPII, unlike α2ββ'ω, does not have helicase activity.  

>>> ○ **5th.** Transcription is initiated: PIC (pre-initiation complex) is formed.  

>>>> ○ GTF is also involved in transcription initiation.

>> ○ Among histones, H3 is the one where the most modifications can occur.

>> ○ Histone acetylation

>>> ○ Positively charged amino acids lysine and arginine play a key role in histone condensation

>>> ○ NH<sub>2</sub> groups in the functional groups of lysine and arginine act as bases

>>> ○ Histone neutralization occurs when acetyl group (-COCH3) is bound to NH2 group of lysine and arginine

>>> ○ Histone neutralization → weakening electrostatic binding between DNA and histones → sedation and transcription activation

>> ○ Histone deacetylation: Opposition of histone acetylation

>>> ○ Valproic acid: an inhibitor of histone deacetylase.

>> ○ Histone methylation: Increased histone positive charge → DNA-histone electrical bond ↑ → Heterochromatinization and transcription inactivation

>> ○ Histone phosphorylation: Different transcription activity and inactivation for each phosphorylation group

>> ○ Histone Modifications and their Effects on Activation/Inhibition

>>> ○ Only lysine amino acids can undergo mono-, di-, tri-methylation.

>> ○ 45S rDNA → 5S rRNA in phosphorous (by RNA pol III)

> ② Prokaryotes: Requires three rRNAs (5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA), one RNA pol

> ③ Ribosome Assembly

>> ○ Proteins synthesized from ribosomes in the cytoplasm are delivered to the phosphorus through the nuclear pores

>> ○ Protein and rRNA assemble in phosphorus → two ribosomal subunits

>> ○ Ribosome small subunit and large subunit are assembled after migration to cytoplasm (translation initiation complex)

> ④ Eukaryotic Ribosomes: 80S

>> ○ 60S large subunit: 28S, 5.8S, 5S rRNA + 40 ~ 50 different proteins, tRNA binding site

>>> ○ A site (amino site)

>>> ○ P site (peptide site)

>>> ○ E site (exit site)

>> ○ 40S small subunit: 18S rRNA + 30 protein, mRNA binding sites

> ⑤ Prokaryotes ribosomes: Contains about 55 proteins, 70S (high bacteria 70S ribosomes)

>> ○ 50S large subunit: 5S, 23S rRNA

>> ○ 30S small subunit: 16S rRNA

> ⑥ snoRNA is involved in rRNA processing  

>> ○ Bacteria: rRNA processing via rRNA cleavage, RNase III, RNase P, RNase E involvement

⑶ 1<sup>st</sup>. Initiation: Ribosomes bind to the ribosome binding site (RBS)  

> ① Initiation of prokaryotes

>> ○ SD-Shine-Dalgarno sequence: Purine-rich sequence of 5'-AGGAGGU-3 '

>> ○ 30S subunit (16S rRNA + protein) binds to Shine-Dalgarno sequence and moves until AUG of mRNA

>> ○ Initiation tRNA (formyl-Met-tRNA) recognizes initiation codon of mRNA and binds to P site (using GTP)

>> ○ Combination of Initiators (IF-1, IF-2, IF-3) with Large Monomers to Form Translation Initiation Complexes

> ② Initiation of eukaryotes

>> ○ Begin with the subunit binding to the 5'-cap end of mRNA: 18S rRNA bound

>> ○ Presence of consensus sequence called Kozac sequence before initiation codon

>> ○ Met-tRNA binds to P-site after recognition of mRNA initiation codon (using GTP)

>> ○ Initiators and large monomers combine to form translation initiation complexes

⑷ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Elongation

> ① A site, P site, E site

>> ○ A site: Site where aa-tRNA enters translation initiation complex

>> ○ P site: Sites where peptide bonds are formed to lengthen amino acid chains

>> ○ E site: tRNA exits the translation initiation complex

>> ○ 5 '-E-P-A-3' in order, don't confuse

> ② Elongation factor: EF-Tu, EF-Ts, EF-G

> ③ codon recognition: Complementary tRNAs involve codon recognition of the A site, require 2 GTP, and involve EF-Tu and EF-Ts

> ④ peptide bond formation: Peptide bond formation with the carboxyl group of the peptide terminal of P site and the amino group of A site amino acid

>> ○ According to peptide transferase activity of large monomer) (Amino acid synthesis direction: N → C

> ⑤ As a result, all of the amino acid chains of the P site are suspended in the tRNA of the A site.

⑹ Genetic code

> ① Do not use duplicate translations: One codon translated only once

> ② Password Directionality: Codon reading in 5 'to 3' direction based on mRNA

> ③ Initiation codon: Beginning of translation always begins at AUG (Met) of mRNA

> ④ nonsense codon: Of the 64 codons, 3 of the codons are termination codons (UAA, UAG, UGA), so the amino acid designation ×

> ⑤ Wobble hypothesis: There are 61 tRNAs in theory but about 45 in reality.

>> ○ Associated with the deaminoation process where the A base turns into inosine acid (I)

>> ○ Present when a particular codon forms a bond with a non-complementary tRNA

>> ○ The sequence of the third codon is called the wobble sequence, and the binding with tRNA is called wobble pairing.  

>> ○ Theory: The first base of the anticodon and the third base of the codon do not bind strictly

> ⑥ Degeneration: As approximately 20 amino acids correspond to two or more codons (45), tRNA → amino acid

>> ○ Codon usage: Even if the same amino acid is produced, the translation speed varies depending on the tRNA

>> ○ Some studies identify the amount of tRNA in the pool and replace it with an appropriate codon to speed up translation  

> ⑦ Unambiguity: By ⑤,⑥, one codon corresponds to one amino acid, mRNA → amino acid

>> ○ Exception: One codon corresponds to multiple anticodons

> ⑧ universal codon

>> ○ Genetic code evolved early in life's history

>> ○ Keeps unchanged because even minimal changes can be fatal

>> ○ Some protozoa, found exceptions in mitochondria

> ⑨ overlapping gene: Viruses have a small amount of genomes, so information overlap (translational violations) is observed, one base interpreted up to six times, and one mutation has a significant effect
