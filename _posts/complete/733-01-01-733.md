## **2. Uniform Circular Motion**

 ⑴ Centripetal Acceleration and Tangential Acceleration

> ① Centripetal acceleration: Acceleration towards the center in uniform circular motion

>> ○ (Note) Uniform circular motion involves acceleration because the direction of motion constantly changes

>> ○ Always 0 in uniform circular motion

>> ○ Represented by α

 ⑵ Centrifugal Force

> ① Definition **:** Centripetal acceleration × Mass of the object

> ② Acts perpendicular to the object's motion direction, so it doesn't increase the object's energy

> ③ Centripetal Force

>> ○ Definition **:** Hypothetical force acting radially outward in an accelerating reference frame rotating with the object

>> ○ From the perspective of an observer rotating at the same speed **:** The object appears stationary. Equilibrium relationship between centripetal force and centrifugal force

## **3. Non-Uniform Circular Motion**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition **:** Net force acting on an object in the direction not perpendicular to the motion direction in circular motion

> ② Period, angular velocity, etc., are not observed to be constant

 ⑵ Theory of Non-Uniform Circular Motion

> ① Non-uniform circular motion of a single point mass

> ② Non-uniform circular motion of multiple point masses

>> ○ r vector **:** Vector from the center of rotation to the point mass

>> ○ Direction of τ **:** Direction where your thumb points when you curl your fingers from r vector to F vector at a small angle

 ⑶ Rotational Inertia (Moment of Inertia)

> ① Definition **:** Sum of the squares of the individual masses (mi) multiplied by the square of their distances (ri) from the axis of rotation Σmi ri2 (unit **:** kg·㎡)

> ② Rotational inertia of multiple objects

**Table. 2.** Rotational Inertia of Multiple Objects

> ③ Corresponds to linear momentum p = mv in translational motion

> ④ Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum

>> ○ Law of Torques **:** If there is symmetry, there must be a corresponding conserved quantity

>> ○ The universe has rotational symmetry in space

>> ○ The corresponding conserved quantity is believed to be angular momentum

 ⑺ Rotational Energy

> ① Formulation

> ② Rotational energy corresponds to translational kinetic energy in translational motion

> ③ When an object has both translational and rotational motion, total kinetic energy is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic energies

## **4. Tools and Torque**

 ⑴ Lever

> ① Definition **:** A tool for gaining mechanical advantage by setting a fulcrum point, an effort point, and a load point on a beam

>> ○ Fulcrum point **:** The point where the beam rests on the fulcrum base

>> ○ Effort point **:** The point where the lever applies force to the object

>> ○ Load point **:** The point where force acts on the lever

> ② Principle of the lever

> ③ Types of levers

>> ○ First-class lever **:** Lever with effort and load points on either side of the fulcrum

>>> ○ Examples **:** Scissors, wrench, balance scale, rope, etc.

>> ○ Second-class lever **:** Lever with the effort point between the load point and the fulcrum

>>> ○ Examples **:** Bottle opener, wheelbarrow, nail clipper, etc.

>> ○ Third-class lever **:** Lever with the load point between the effort point and the fulcrum

>>> ○ Examples **:** Tweezers, fishing rod, chopsticks, etc.

 ⑵ Axle and Wheel

> ① Definition **:** A device consisting of two circular wheels of different diameters attached to a common axis, allowing them to rotate together

> ② Principle of the axle and wheel **:** Same as the principle of the lever

> ③ Types of axle and wheel

>> ○ Fixed pulley **:** Can lift an object with the same force as its weight by pulling at a constant velocity

> ④ Examples **:** Car steering wheel, gear shift lever, bicycle gears, etc.

 ⑶ **Principle of Work** **:** When using a tool to perform work, even if there is a mechanical advantage, the amount of work remains unchanged due to losses in distance traveled
