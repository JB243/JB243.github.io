## **1\. Maxwell's First Law** (Gauss's Law for Electricity)

 ⑴ Definition **:** Electric field is created when there is a charge

> ① (Reference) **Circuit theory** is related to Gauss's law for electricity

 ⑵ Mathematical expression **:** Using divergence theorem

> ① D is referred to as electric flux density

> ② The integral of the electric field along a Gaussian surface surrounding the charge is equal to the charge divided by the permittivity in space

 ⑶ **Example 1.** Electric field and potential at a distance r from the center of a point charge with charge q (Coulomb's Law)

 ⑷ **Example 2.** Electric field and potential of a uniformly charged infinite straight conductor with linear charge density λ (C/m)

 ⑸ **Example 3.** Electric field and potential of a uniformly charged infinite plane conductor with surface charge density σ (C/m²)

## **2\. Dipole** 

 ⑴ Definition **:** State where two point charges with opposite polarities are fixed at a distance d apart

 ⑵ Dipole moment is represented by the arrow ⤉

> ① In physics, the direction of the dipole moment is (-)pole → (+)pole

> ② In chemistry, the direction of the dipole moment is (+)pole → (-)pole, reflecting the atomic structure with a nucleus at the center

 ⑶ Potential due to a dipole

> ① V(r, θ) **:** Potential at a location with distance r from the center of the electric dipole and an angle θ with the direction of the dipole moment

> ② Assumption **:** r is much larger than d

> ③ V(r, θ) inversely proportional to r² and directly proportional to cos θ **:** Different from the general potential that inversely depends on r
