> ① Continuity of geological structures observed across the Atlantic Ocean.

> ② Identical plant fossils found on various continents.

> ③ Traces of Ice Age glaciers in tropical regions.

> ④ Matching coastlines of South America and Africa.

> ⑤ Later, inconsistencies in the path of movement were discovered in paleomagnetic studies and became accepted as the theory.

> ⑥ The peninsula landmasses during the Ice Age were located between the southern peninsula and the equator.

⑵ Driving Forces of Plate Motion

> ① **Factor 1:** Mantle convection

> ② **Factor 2:** Slab pull

>> ○ Plates are denser as they are subducted.

>> ○ Result: Plates are dragged upwards due to tension.

> ③ **Factor 3:** Slab suction

>> ○ Slabs detach and rapidly descend during subduction.

>> ○ Result: Intensification of mantle convection, subduction of plates.

> ④ **Factor 4:** Ridge push

>> ○ Ridges push plates away with gravitational slopes.
