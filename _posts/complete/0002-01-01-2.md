## **1. Terminology Describing Electric Phenomena**

⑴ Charge

> ① Definition **:** Fundamental property causing electric phenomena

> ② Types of charge **:** Positive and negative charges; like charges repel, unlike charges attract

>> ○ Difference from gravity is in having only one polarity

> ③ Amount of charge **:** Measurement of charge magnitude

>> ○ Unit **:** Coulomb (C)

>> ○ Charge of one electron **:** -1.6 × 10<sup>-19</sup> C

>> ○ Number of electrons in 1 C **:** 6.25 × 10<sup>18</sup>

>> ○ Coulomb's constant and Avogadro's number (6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup>) are unrelated

>> ○ Charge of 1 mole of electrons = (6.02 × 10<sup>23</sup>) × (1.6 × 10<sup>-19</sup>) = 96,485 C

>> ○ Small size of fundamental charge allows for continuous consideration of charge

> ④ Copper at 20 ℃ has electron density of 1023 electrons/cm3

> ⑤ Separation of charges creates voltage, and flow of charges creates current

⑵ Electric Current

> ① Definition **:** Net flow of charged particles per unit time, such as electrons or ions

>> ○ Conductors or wires **:** Allow free electrons to flow as current

>> ○ Electrolytes **:** Allow charged ions to flow as current

>> ○ Vacuum tubes (discharge tubes) **:** Allow flow of positive ions and electrons as current

>> ○ Unit **:** C/s = A

> ② Direction of Current

>> ○ Movement of charges **:** Electrons move when a force is applied, nuclei remain fixed

>> ○ Direction of current **:** (+) → (-)

>> ○ Direction of free electrons **:** (-) → (+)

>> ○ Direction of positive charges **:** (+) → (-)

> ③ **Type 1.** Drift Current

>> ○ Definition **:** Movement of free electrons due to electric field in a conductor

>> ○ Electrons are more mobile than positive holes

>> ○ Ohm's law applies to drift current only

>> ○ Application **:** Field-effect transistors (FET)

> ④ **Type 2.** Convection Current or Diffusion Current

>> ○ Definition **:** Current due to movement or diffusion of charged particles like electrons, positive holes, or ions

>> ○ Notable in vacuum or rarefied gases

>> ○ Application **:** PN junction diodes, bipolar junction transistors (BJT), cathode-ray tubes, vacuum tubes

> ⑤ **Type 3.** Polarizing Current **:** Time-dependent variation of polarization charge

> ⑥ **Type 4.** Displacement Current **:** Time-dependent variation in charge density, not carried by actual charge carriers

 ⑶ Electric Potential

> ① Electric Field **:** Magnitude of electric force per unit charge

> ② Electric Potential **:** Electric potential energy per unit charge

> ③ Voltage **:** Energy required to separate charges per unit charge (Unit **:** J/C = V)

> ④ Relation between Electric Field and Electric Potential in Uniform Field

> ⑤ Electric field is represented by slope of potential-distance graph

 ⑷ Power **:** Rate of work done by an electrical device, 1 horsepower (hp) = 735 W

> ① Power in a Resistor

> ② Power in an Electric Motor

> ③ Sign of Power

>> ○ Positive value **:** Energy is delivered to circuit component

>> ○ Negative value **:** Energy is dissipated from circuit component

> ④ **Tip:** Power in a resistor is **always positive**

>> ○ i.e., when current flows, it's positive power; when opposite, it's negative power

>> ○ Note that this is a matter of definition rather than actual sign

## **3. Concentrated Constant System and Distributed Constant System**

⑴ Concentrated Constant System

> ① All parts of the system sense external physical quantities simultaneously for rigid bodies

> ② Application of KCL, KVL, V-I characteristics is possible

⑵ Distributed Constant System

> ① All parts of the system do not experience the same physical quantities simultaneously for flexible bodies

> ② Interpretation only possible through numerical analysis

⑶ Criteria for Judgment

> ① If the propagation time for a wave through the system is much smaller than the period of external sources, it's a concentrated constant system

> ② Example **:** If the system's characteristic length is comparable to the size of a lab, and the frequency of the power supply is 60 Hz
