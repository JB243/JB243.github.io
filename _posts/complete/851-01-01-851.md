## **1\. Inhomogeneity 1.** Polarization

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Polarization **:** The phenomenon where the distribution of charges within an object is rearranged when an external electric field is applied. Electric dipoles are created.

> ② Dielectric **:** A substance where polarization occurs when an electric field is applied.

> ③ Permittivity or Dielectric Constant **:** The degree of polarization occurring in a dielectric material.

>> ○ Represents the electrical characteristic of an insulator; higher insulation results in larger permittivity.

>> ○ In chemistry, the fact that higher polarity of a solvent leads to a greater dielectric constant is important.

>> ○ The ratio by which the strength of an electric field decreases due to polarization.

>> ○ (Note) Regular air has a negligible conductivity.

>> ○ (Note) Conductivity increases on rainy days, leading to more significant attenuation.

>> ④ Polarization Current **:** Temporal variation of polarized charge.

 ⑵ Types of Polarization

> ① Molecular Polarization **:** Also known as dipole orientation polarization.

>> ○ When an electric field is applied to a dipolar molecule, it undergoes rotational force and becomes polarized.

>> ○ High temperature reduces polarization due to molecular thermal vibration.

> ② Ionic Polarization **:** Also known as atomic polarization.

>> ○ Applying an electric field to an ionic crystal induces relative changes in positive and negative ions, resulting in induced electric dipoles.

>> ○ Depending on the structure, various displacement ranges occur, allowing for high permittivity.

>> ○ Commonly found in ceramic compounds.

> ③ Electronic Polarization

>> ○ When an atom is placed in an electric field E, opposing forces act on the nucleus and the electron cloud (because the polarity of the nucleus and the electron cloud is different).

>> ○ The atom becomes a dipole and polarization occurs. The magnitude of this polarization is very small.

>> ○ Induced to a certain extent in all atoms.

>> ○ Reacts rapidly to changes in electric field of high frequency without significant phase difference.

> ④ Interfacial Polarization **:** Also known as space charge polarization.

>> ○ Occurs when mobile charges within a polycrystalline solid receive the electric field, but their movement is hindered at interfaces.

>> ○ The slight movement of electrons within the crystal creates polarization, mimicking the effect of having high permittivity.

>> ○ DC Electric Field **:** Strongly influenced by polarization. Increases relative permittivity.

>> ○ AC Electric Field **:** In low-frequency range, interfacial polarization diminishes and becomes less significant.

 ⑶ Bound Charges and Capacitance

> ① Bound Charge Density P **:** Polarization per unit area.

> ② Displacement Current Density D **:** Surface charge density per unit area.

> ③ Electric Susceptibility χe

 ⑷ Dielectrics in AC Electric Fields

**Figure 1.** Dielectrics in AC Electric Fields [Footnote 1]

> ① Charging Current (ic) **:** The current flowing to charge the dielectric-filled electrodes when the switch is closed.

> ② Absorption Current (id) **:** The current that decreases over time and is absorbed by the dielectric.

> ③ Leakage Current (il) **:** The current that flows steadily over a long period due to carriers within the dielectric.

> ④ Discharge Current (ic') **:** The current that flows when the charge stored in the capacitor is discharged upon shorting the switch.

> ⑤ Residual Current (id') **:** The current that decreases over time and flows due to remaining charges.

> ⑥ For most dielectrics, ic = ic' and id = id' hold true.

> ⑦ Dielectric After-Effect **:** A phenomenon where absorption and residual currents flow. Takes time for polarization to occur or disappear.

 ⑸ Frequency Characteristics of Polarization Rate

> ① At low frequencies, changes in dielectric polarization roughly correspond to changes in the electric field.

> ② At high frequencies, dielectric polarization lags behind frequency changes → permittivity decreases.

> ③ At frequencies above 1 GHz, only ion polarization and electronic polarization occur, with interfacial and molecular polarization disappearing.

 ⑹ Dielectric Loss **:** Also known as dielectric heating.

> ① Definition **:** Energy loss due to the reversal of electric dipoles and leakage current, emitted as thermal energy.

>> ○ **Example 1.** Dielectrics composed only of dipole molecules exhibit maximum energy loss at frequencies of 104 ~ 109 Hz.

>> ○ **Example 2.** Microwaves maximize dielectric loss in target substances, while selecting lower frequencies for other materials.

> ② Loss Tangent **:** Dielectric loss angle, also known as loss coefficient.

>> ○ Equivalent circuit of dielectrics in AC electric field: parallel circuit of resistance and capacitor.

>> ○ IC **:** Conduction current. The current when no loss occurs.

>> ○ IR **:** Resistance current. The current when loss occurs.

>> ○ At a specific frequency f where displacement current equals conduction current, the loss angle tan δ of the dielectric is given by f tan δ = fc, where fc is the frequency where the equality holds.

> ③ Dissipation Factor = Energy Loss per Frequency / (2π × Stored Maximum Energy) **:** Equivalent to loss tangent.
