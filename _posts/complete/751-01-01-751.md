## **1\. Overview**

 ⑴ Maxwell's Third Law

> ① When external current flows, magnetic force is generated.

> ② The intensity of the magnetic field (H) is determined by magnetic force and magnetic resistance.

 ⑵ Magnetic flux or magnetic flux density **:** Number of magnetic lines passing through an arbitrary cross-sectional area.

> ① Denoted by Φ.

> ② Unit **:** Weber (Wb)

 ⑶ Magnetization or magnetic flux density **:** Magnetization per unit area, i.e., B = Φ / A

> ① Denoted by B.

> ② Unit **:** Wb / m² = Tesla (T) = 10,000 Gauss (G)

 ⑷ Magnetic field

> ① Denoted by H.

> ② Terminology confusion

>> ○ Generally, magnetic field refers to B.

>> ○ Strictly, magnetic field means H.

>> ○ B will be used to represent magnetic field from now on.

> ② Vacuum or air **:** Magnetic flux density B and magnetic field intensity H are linearly related.

> ③ Magnetic materials

>> ○ Represented by hysteresis curve or B-H curve.

**Figure. 1.** Hysteresis Curve

>> ○ Retentivity

>> ○ Coercivity

>> ○ High Retentivity **:** Permanent magnets, advantageous for memory devices.

>> ○ Low Retentivity **:** Advantageous for AC circuit magnetic circuits.

>> ○ **Area Dimension Analysis** **:** ［B × H］= J / m³ = Energy per unit volume

>> ○ Area under one cycle of B-H curve = Energy stored in the magnet and then lost as heat = **Energy loss** in AC operation.

>> ○ (Note) Hysteresis loss

>> ○ Measured by VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometer)

 ⑴ Ampere's Law

> ① Law

> ② Vacuum or air

> ③ Right-hand screw rule **:** The direction in which the current flows is determined by the right-hand thumb, and the direction in which the other fingers wrap around is the direction.

> ④ **Example 1.** Magnetic field of infinitely long straight wire

>> ○ When two infinitely long straight wires have the same direction of current flow

**Figure. 1.** When two infinitely long straight wires have the same direction of current flow

>> ○ When two infinitely long straight wires have opposite directions of current flow

**Figure. 2.** When two infinitely long straight wires have opposite directions of current flow

> ⑥ **Example 3.** Toroid **:** Solenoid bent into a donut shape

 ⑵ Biot-Savart Law

> ① Definition

> ② **Application 1.** Magnetic field at the center of a circular wire with radius R and current I

## **3\. Lorentz Force**

 ⑴ Definition **:** The force (magnetic force) experienced by a wire carrying charge or current under a magnetic field

 ⑵ Determination of the direction of magnetic force

> ① Fleming's Left-hand Rule

>> ○ If the current direction (+ → -) is the left hand thumb and the magnetic field direction (N → S) is the left hand index finger, the left hand thumb becomes the direction of Lorentz force.

>> ○ (Note) Fleming's Right-hand Rule is used in generators involving Maxwell's Fourth Law.

**Figure. 3.** Fleming's Left-hand Rule

> ② Right-hand Rule of Magnetic Force

>> ○ If the current direction (+ → -) is the right-hand thumb and the magnetic field direction (N → S) is the other fingers of the right hand, the palm becomes the direction of the force.

**Figure. 4.** Right-hand Rule of Magnetic Force

> ③ Determination of direction using vector cross product ( **Preferred** )

>> ○ Using the right hand, grasp the current direction and magnetic field direction in order; the thumb points in the direction of Lorentz force.

 ⑶ **Example 1.** Force exerted on a wire carrying current **:** Current _I_, length L

 ⑷ **Example 2.** Force experienced by a moving charge within a constant magnetic field **:** Charge q, velocity v

 ⑸ **Example 3.** Electric motor

**Figure. 5.** Principle of a Motor

Brushes, i.e., commutators, are clearly shown in the figure above.

> ① The direction of the rotational force changes periodically, causing oscillatory motion.

> ② Commutator

>> ○ Device that ensures the coil of the electric motor rotates in a consistent direction.

>> ○ Allows current to flow through the coil via contact with the brushes.

>> ○ Brushes **:** Reverse the direction of current flow through the coil every half turn, ensuring continuous rotation in the same direction.

> ③ Electric motors have brushes, while [generators](https://jb243.github.io/pages/753) do not due to alternating current (AC).

 ⑺ **Example 5.** Hall Effect

**Figure. 7.** Hall Effect

> ① The magnetic flux generated by the D-shaped wire and the conductor plate causes induced current to flow in the -y direction in the conductor plate.

> ② **Case 1.** When the charge carrier is positively charged

>> ○ Moves in the -y direction due to positive charge.

>> ○ Also moves in the -x direction due to Lorentz force.

>> ○ **Expected Result 1.** Magnetic force is generated in the -x direction in the conductor plate.

>> ○ **Expected Result 2.** The potential at point b is higher than at point a in the conductor plate.

> ③ **Case 2.** When the charge carrier is negatively charged

>> ○ Moves in the +y direction due to negative charge.

>> ○ Also moves in the -x direction due to Lorentz force.

>> ○ **Expected Result 1.** Magnetic force is generated in the -x direction in the conductor plate.

>> ○ **Expected Result 2.** The potential at point b is higher than at point a in the conductor plate.

> ④ Actual result

>> ○ The potential at point b is higher than at point a.

>> ○ Conclusion **:** The charge

 carrier is negatively charged.
