## **1\. Magnetic Field**

 ⑴ Definition **:** A vector quantity that represents the magnetic flux density per unit area, denoted as **B**, with magnitude and direction.

 ⑵ Generation **:** Generated through the motion of charged particles or currents.

 ⑶ Direction **:** Illustrated by the right-hand rule, where the direction is determined by the motion of charged particles or current.

 ⑷ Magnetic Force **:** Also known as Lorentz force.

 ⑸ Generation of Electromagnetic Waves **:** Occurs when electric and magnetic fields vary with time.

> ① Energy calculations involve the concept of [Poynting vector](https://jb243.github.io/pages/851#footnote_link_67_51).

> ② The existence of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is due to the mutual induction of electric and magnetic fields.

## **2\. Magnetic Materials and Magnetization**

 ⑴ Intrinsic Magnetization

> ① Magnetic susceptibility or magnetization **:** The degree to which a substance becomes magnetized when subjected to an external magnetic field.

> ② In most materials, internal polarization **M** 0 is proportional to the magnetic field **B** 0: the proportionality constant is magnetic susceptibility.

> ② Protons with spin-up have the lowest energy level.

> ③ Even if energy is temporarily absorbed, the MR signal is generated as the substance returns to its original state.

> ④ Increasing the magnetic field strength → increasing intrinsic magnetization **M** 0 → increasing MR signal.

 ⑵ Magnetic Materials and Magnetization

 **Figure 2.** Magnetic Hysteresis Curve and Magnetic Materials

> ① Diamagnetic **:** Except for superconductors, χ value is very small and negative.

>> ○ Macroscopic cause **:** The entire material is weakly magnetized in the opposite direction of the external magnetic field.

>> ○ Microscopic cause **:** All materials exhibit weak diamagnetism due to the motion of electrons around nuclei (Lenz's law).

>> ○ Weak repulsion under a magnetic field.

>> ○ Superconductors are also diamagnetic (Meissner effect).

> ② Paramagnetic **:** χ is small and positive.

>> ○ Macroscopic cause

>>> ○ No external magnetic field **:** Magnetic moments become disorderly.

>>> ○ External magnetic field present **:** Aligns magnetically moments in a parallel direction, creating weak attraction (due to rotation caused by torque).

>>> ○ Reason for weak attraction **:** Thermal motion of atoms disrupts the alignment of magnetic moments.

>>> ○ Lowering temperature in paramagnetic materials enhances magnetization.

>> ○ Microscopic cause

>>> ○ Present in molecules with unpaired electrons in MO theory.

>>> ○ Specifically in molecules with unoccupied electron shells.

>>> ○ Examples: Transition elements, rare earth elements, actinides.

> ③ Ferromagnetic **:** χ is very large and positive.

>> ○ Macroscopic cause

>>> ○ Ferromagnetic materials have internal regions called magnetic domains.

>>> ○ Exchange coupling **:** Interaction between the spin of one atom and the spin of adjacent atoms.

>>> ○ Despite atomic thermal motion, magnetic moments within specific domains remain aligned in the same direction due to exchange coupling.

>>> ○ No external magnetic field **:** Magnetic moments of each domain are disorderly, so no overall magnetic field is observed.

>>> ○ External magnetic field present **:** Magnetic moments within each domain align in the direction of the external magnetic field (due to rotation caused by torque).

>>> ○ After the removal of an external magnetic field **:** Magnetic moments within each domain remain orderly, and magnetization persists for a long time.

>> ○ Mainly found in metallic materials: iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, ferric oxide, etc.

>> ○ Ferromagnetic materials can also be further classified as ferro-magnetic, ferri-magnetic, antiferro-magnetic, etc.

>> ○ Curie temperature

>>> ○ When the temperature of a ferromagnetic material exceeds a critical temperature, exchange coupling is disrupted, and the alignment of magnetic domains can no longer be maintained.

>>> ○ Above this temperature, atomic thermal motion becomes significant, causing ferromagnetic materials to lose ferromagnetism and become paramagnetic.

>>> ○ This temperature is called the Curie temperature.

**Table 1.** Curie Temperatures of Various Substances

>> ○ Lightning-Induced Remanent Magnetism

>>> ○ Phenomenon where the surrounding magnetite becomes magnetized and turns into a magnet when struck by lightning.

>>> ○ Mechanism for the formation of natural magnets.

>> ○ **Magnetic Hysteresis Phenomenon**

>>> ○ Hysteresis phenomenon **:** Physical quantities of a material are determined not only by its current state but also by the process of change in its state.

>>>> ○ Hysteresis is not unique to magnetic hysteresis.

>>>> ○ Examples: Hysteresis in stress-strain curves, rate functions.

>>> ○ Represented as μH is magnetic flux density.

>>> ○ Magnetic flux density **:** Describes the strength of a magnetic field.

>>> ○ Hysteresis Loop **:** Curve depicting the process of change in the magnetic field of ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials in response to varying external magnetic fields.

**Figure 3.** Hysteresis Loop or Hysteresis Curve

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> Initial Magnetization Curve (O → D)

>>>> ○ Initially, the magnetic field of the material increases rapidly when an external magnetic field is applied to a demagnetized ferromagnetic substance.

>>>> ○ The increase in the magnetic field's strength slows down, and the magnetic field stops increasing.

>>>> ○ Each magnetic domain within the ferromagnetic substance aligns completely with the external magnetic field.

>>>> ○ Magnetic Saturation **:** The phenomenon where further increases in the external magnetic field do not lead to an increase in the ferromagnetic substance's magnetic field.

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> Decreasing External Magnetic Field (D → E)

>>>> ○ The magnetic domains of the ferromagnetic substance maintain a certain level of alignment rather than returning to their initial state.

>>>> ○ Consequently, the hysteresis loop does not return to point O.

>>>> ○ Residual Magnetic Field **:** The magnetic field at point E.

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> Applying an Opposite External Magnetic Field (E → F → G)

>>>> ○ At point F, the magnetic field of the ferromagnetic substance decreases further until it reaches zero.

>>>> ○ The external magnetic field at point F is called coercive force or coercivity.

>>>> ○ Increasing the strength of the opposite external magnetic field realigns the magnetic domains in the opposite direction, leading to saturation.

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup> Decreasing the Opposite External Magnetic Field and Reapplying the Initial Magnetic Field

>>>> ○ The material returns to state D after passing point J.

>>> ○ Measured using a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM).

>>> ○ **Application 1:** Permanent Magnets **:** Maintain a magnetic field without an external magnetic field → Hysteresis loop is rectangular, and coercivity should be high.

>>> ○ **Application 2:** Used in electromagnets or transformer iron cores **:** Sensitive to external magnetic fields → Residual magnetic field is large, and coercivity is small.

>> ○ Ferromagnetic materials cause significant artifacts in MRI compared to diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup> Generally, electron-electron interactions result in repulsion.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup> As electrons move, they interact with lattice, causing electron-phonon interactions.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> At lower temperatures, the influence of electron-phonon interactions becomes apparent.
