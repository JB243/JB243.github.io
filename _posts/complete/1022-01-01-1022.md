**Q.** In general, in biochemical reactions, carbonyl groups (C=O) are atoms that are attacked by nucleophiles. Therefore, the C = O double bond of the peptide bond (-CONH-) of the polypeptide chain can be hydrolyzed under water attack. This reaction is very slow and requires the help of enzymes, and protein lyase such as carboxypeptidase catalyzes this reaction. In order for carboxypeptidase to have full activity, Zn (II) metal ions are required. Based on this fact, answer the following questions.

<br>

⑴ Type of protein lyase

> ① Pepsin **:** Endopeptidase that recognizes and cleaves the amino terminus (N terminus) of Phe, Trp, and Tyr

> ② Trypsin **:** Endopeptidase that recognizes and cleaves the carboxy terminus (C terminus) of Lys and Arg

> ③ Chymotrypsin **:** Endopeptidase that recognizes and cleaves the carboxy terminus (C terminus) of phenyl group-containing amino acids (Phe, Trp, Tyr)

> ④ Carboxypeptidase **:** Exopeptidase that recognizes and cleaves the carboxy terminus (C terminus) in proteins

⑵ If the Zn (II) metal ion is present at the active site of the carboxypeptidase, answer the reason why the reaction rate is fast..

<br>

> Summary **:** Carboxypeptidase, trypsin and chymotrypsin recognize the  carboxyl group so that they cleave proteins.

> Zn (II) accelerates the reaction because Zn (II) lowers the activation energy by electrostatically fixing the reaction environment..

⑶ Explain the role of histidine in serine's nucleophilic attack on peptide bonds in the catalytic mechanism of chymotrypsin enzymes.

> The same reason with ⑵. Histidine is a positively charged amino acid along with lysine and arginine, and plays a role in fixing the reaction environment like Zn (II).
