## **2\. Organic Chemistry Structural Formulas**

⑴ Sequence

> ① SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line Entry System): A short ASCII string representation.

>> ○ Double bonds are represented by '=', and triple bonds are represented by '#'.

>> ○ For cyclic compounds, numbers like 1, 2, etc., are assigned to indicate that the ends of a linear molecule are connected to form a ring.

>>> ○ Example: CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C (= caffeine)

>> ○ C represents normal carbon, whereas c represents aromatic carbon

>>> ○ C1CCCCC1: cyclohexane 

>>> ○ c1ccccc1: benzene 

>> ○ Brackets can be used to indicate more complex cases.

>>> ○ Can also display charge notation like [N+]

>> ○ @ symbol can be used to represent a stereocenter in a molecule.

>>> ○ Example: C[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C

>> ○ / and \ symbols can be used to represent E/Z isomers.

>>> ○ Example: CCC/C(=C/C(=O)OCC)/C(=O)OCC

> ② SMARTS (SMILES arbitrary target specification): Language for specifying structural patterns of molecules.

>> ○ Example: [#6]-[#7]1:[#6]:[#7]:[#6]2:[#6]:1:[#6](=[#8]):[#7](:[#6](=[#8]):[#7]:2-[#6])-[#6]

>> ○ Reference: _Daylight Chem Info Systems_

> ③ SELFIES (SELF-referencing embedded strings)

>> ○ Example: [C][N][C][=N][C][=C][Ring1][Ring2][C][Branch1_3][epsilon][=O][N][Branch1_3][Branch2_2][C][Branch1_3][epsilon][=O][N][Ring1][Branch1_3][C][C]

>> ○ Reference: _NIPS_ , 2019

> ④ InChI

>> ○ Example: 1S/C9UBO4/c1-6(10)13-8-S-3-2-4-7(8)9(11)12/h2-5H,1H3,(H,11,12)

>> ○ C9UBO4: Chemical Formula

>> ○ c1-6(10)13-8-S-3-2-4-7(8)9(11)12: Connections of Atoms

>> ○ h2-5H,1H3,(H,11,12): Hydrogen Atoms

> ⑤ InChIKey

>> ○ Disadvantage of InChI: Can be lengthy

>> ○ InChIKey condenses the InChI into a digital representation using 27 uppercase letters, designed to facilitate web searches.

> ⑥ Embedding Vector

>> ○ Depending on the type of compression algorithm used, various embedding vectors can exist.

>> ○ Reference: _Nature Biotech_, 2020
 
⑵ Basic Structural Formulas

> ① Kekulé structure (dash formula): Line structural formula without indicating non-bonding electron pairs.

> ② Lewis structure: Line structural formula indicating non-bonding electron pairs.

> ③ Lewis dot structure: Lewis structure with shared bond lines represented as electron pairs.

> ④ Condensed structure

>> ○ Example: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>

> ⑤ Skeletal structure (bond-line formula): Lewis structure without showing carbon and hydrogen atoms.

>> ○ Common in organic chemistry.

>> ○ Carbon atoms often shown to emphasize or clarify.

>> ○ Carbon always forms a tetrahedral structure, so it is assumed that each carbon atom has a corresponding number of hydrogen atoms.

> ⑥ Fisher projection

>> ○ 2D representation of 3D organic molecules invented by Hermann Emil Fischer.

>> ○ Represents stereochemistry with a 2D cross.

>> ○ Represents 3D arrangement in a 2D format using specific rules, instead of wedges and dashes.

>> ○ **Rule 1.** Horizontal atoms come out of the plane, vertical atoms go into the plane.

>> ○ **Rule 2.** Only 180° rotations within the plane are allowed.

>> ○ **Rule 3.** Generally, the most oxidized substituent is placed at the top.

<br>

## **3\. Bond Length and Bond Strength**

⑴ Bond Strength: Measured by bond dissociation energy.

⑵ Bond Length: Average distance between the nuclei of two atoms participating in a bond.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/61cc0c29-9262-4264-b10f-e4d1897ba35f)

**Figure 5.** Average Bond Lengths of Various Bonds (Unit: Å)

<br>

⑶ Trends in Bond Strength and Bond Length

> ①: As bond strength increases, bond length decreases, and vice versa.

> ② Higher bond order leads to increased bond strength and decreased bond length.

> ③ Bond length due to hybrid orbitals

>> ○ sp<sup>3</sup> - sp<sup>3</sup> > sp<sup>3</sup> - sp<sup>2</sup> ＞ sp<sup>3</sup> - sp ＞ sp<sup>2</sup> - sp<sup>2</sup> ＞ sp<sup>2</sup> - sp ＞ sp - sp

> ④ Atomic size: Smaller [atomic radius](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1328#2-classical-atomic-model) leads to shorter bond length.

⑷ [Dipole Moment](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1330#2-dipole-moment)

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Resonance Structures**

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Delocalization of electrons driven by pi electrons or non-bonding electron pairs.

> ② Generally, hybrid structures of each atom remain unchanged among resonance contributors.

>> ○ Example: Hybrid orbitals of each oxygen in -COOH are sp2 and p orbitals.

> ③ Can be divided into resonance involving three or more atoms' non-bonding electrons and resonance involving non-bonding electrons of two atoms.

> ④ Electrons move from electron-rich areas to electron-deficient areas.

> ⑤ Important in benzene acylation mechanism for two atoms' non-bonding electrons.

⑵ Types of Resonance Structures

> ① Allylic lone pair, radical, or other double bonds: 2 curved arrows

> ② Allylic positive charge: 1 curved arrow

> ③ One pair of electrons near a positive charge: 1 curved arrow

> ④ Pi bond between two atoms with different electronegativities

> ⑤ Conjugated pi bonds within a ring structure

**Figure 7.** Resonance Structures of Carbonate Ion

<br>

> ① No single structure accurately represents resonance structures.

> ② Such individual structures are called resonance or resonance contributors.

> ③ Real molecules are understood as a mixture of these structures.

> ② According to X-ray studies, all C-O bond lengths in the carbonate ion are the same; they are longer than double bonds and shorter than single bonds.

⑷ Drawing Resonance Structures

> ① Resonance structures or contributors are indicated by a double-headed arrow ↔.

>> ○ Chemical equilibrium is indicated by ⇌.

> ② Resonance structures are formed only by the movement of electrons.

>> ○ 1,2-hydride shift is not a resonance phenomenon.

> ③ Only pi bond electrons or non-bonding electron pairs can form resonance structures.

> ④ Total number of electrons within the molecule must remain constant.

> ⑤ Resonance structures requiring the breaking of sigma bonds are not plausible.

> ⑥ Second-period elements cannot accommodate more than eight electrons.

> ⑦ Hydrogen atoms can have only up to two electrons.

⑸ Contribution

> ① Resonance contribution: Degree to which each structure is favored among resonance contributors.

>> ○ Major contributor: Resonance contributor most similar to the actual structure.

>> ○ Minor contributor: Resonance contributor less similar to the actual structure.

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. Octet Rule: Resonance contributors violating the octet rule always have the lowest contribution.

>> ○ Example: Resonance contributors with carbocations are likely to be minor contributors.

>> ○ For second-period atoms, no more than 8 electrons in the valence shell.

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Charge Separation: Resonance contributors without charge separation have higher contributions.

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Higher electronegativity at the site of a negative charge leads to higher contribution.

> ⑤ 4<sup>th</sup>. If no difference exists among ② ~ ④, resonance contributors with more bonds have higher contributions.

<br>

⑺ Cautions

> ① Resonance structures of cyclic molecules must consider [aromaticity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370#1-aromaticity).

>> ○ Cyclic molecules that do not satisfy aromaticity cannot overlap pi bonds between carbons stereoelectronically

>> ○ Example: Cyclooctatetraene does not form resonance structures

<br>

## **5. Acid-Base Theory**

⑴ All reactions are classified into acid-base reactions (oxidation number change) and redox reactions (oxidation number remains constant).

⑵ General Chemistry: [Acid and base theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1352)

⑶ Organic Chemistry: Lewis acid and base

> ① Lewis acid and base: Thermodynamically, there is a difference between nucleophiles and electrophiles in reaction rates.

>> ○ In organic chemistry, Lewis acids are referred to as electrophiles, and Lewis bases as nucleophiles.

> ② Nucleophile (Nu): A species that likes nuclei. Reaction-rate related.

>> ○ Example: Electron-rich negative ions, δ<sup>-</sup>, carbon-carbon pi bonds.

>> ○ Nucleophilicity can be lower despite strong basicity due to steric hindrance.

>>> ○ Basicity: t-butoxide > ethoxide

>>> ○ Nucleophilicity: ethoxide > t-butoxide (due to steric hindrance)

> ③ Electrophile (E): A species that likes electrons. Reaction-rate related.

>> ○ Example: Electron-deficient positive ions, δ+. Mainly on carbon δ+.

>> ○ Reason for Br<sub>2</sub> being an electrophile.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/57048f9f-aee7-4157-a1fc-37c9b00f57be)

<br>

> ④ Significance of Basicity as a Thermodynamic Concept

>> ○ Thermodynamics is related to the equilibrium state, i.e., the final state.

>> ○ Higher basicity corresponds to lower pK<sub>b</sub> with respect to equilibrium constant K<sub>b</sub>.

>> ○ That is, basicity indicates which species attracts protons more effectively in the final state.

> ⑤ Significance of Nucleophilicity as a Reaction Rate Concept

>> ○ Relates to which species reacts more quickly initially.

>> ○ Example: t-BuOK reacts slower than EtOK due to steric hindrance, hence lower nucleophilicity.

⑷ **Basicity:** The extent of accepting H+. Acidity and basicity are not absolute.

> ① Overview: Reactivity↑ → Stability ↓ → Basicity ↑

>> ○ Conjugate base of a strong acid is a weak base; conjugate base of a weak acid is a strong base.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/dc8418ed-b421-4823-ace4-000825aaa786)

<br>

>> ○ Acidity and basicity are thermodynamic (reversible reaction exists), while nucleophilicity and electrophilicity are kinetic (irreversible, no reverse reaction).

>>> ○ Example: t-BuOK is a strong base but a weak nucleophile.

>> ○ Factors of basicity

>>> ○ **Factor 1:** Inductive Effect: Inductive effect, electronegativity, resonance, hydrogen bonding, size effect.

>>> ○ **Factor 2:** Resonance Effect: Stabilization due to resonance, polarization, backbone bonding, aromaticity effect.

>>> ○ **Factor 3:** Other Effects: Steric hindrance, solvation effect.

>>> ○ Introduction of [EDG (Electron-Donating Group) and EWG (Electron-Withdrawing Group)](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370#7-substituent-effects) concepts considering both inductive and resonance effects.

> ② **1-1.** **Inductive Effect:** Electron withdrawal or electron donation through σ bonds.

>> ○ Definition: Effect that influences electron density through σ bonds.

>> ○ Differentiate between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing inductive effects.

>> ○ The more functional groups, the more stabilized the carbocation, affecting reaction rate.

<br>

**Figure 17.** Energy levels of carbocations according to substituents

<br>

>> ○ Examples:

>>> ○ CH<sub>3</sub>COOH: The electron-donating effect of the CH<sub>3</sub> group leads to destabilization of the negative charge on the -COO<sup>-</sup> group.

>>> ○ CF<sub>3</sub>COOH: The electron-withdrawing effect of the CF<sub>3</sub> group stabilizes the negative charge on the -COO<sup>-</sup> group.

>>> ○ CF<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> is more stable than CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>, which results in a lower basicity, thus the conjugate acid is stronger.

>>> ○ Acidity comparison: CF<sub>3</sub>COOH > CH<sub>3</sub>COOH

>>> ○ Actual pKa values: CF<sub>3</sub>COOH pK<sub>a</sub> = 0, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH pK<sub>a</sub> = 5

>>> ○ Acidity comparison: (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>COH (pK<sub>a</sub> = 18) < CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH (pK<sub>a</sub> = 16) < H<sub>2</sub>O (pK<sub>a</sub> = 15.7)

> ③ **1-2.** **Electronegativity:** Increases with increasing group number, leading to increased stability and decreased basicity.

>> ○ For elements in the same period, having negative charge on atoms with greater electronegativity results in stability, while having positive charge on such atoms results in instability.

>> ○ Basicity: F<sup>-</sup> < OH<sup>-</sup> < NH<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> < CH<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (due to electronegativity)

>> ○ Acidity: HF (pK<sub>a</sub> = 3.2) > H<sub>2</sub>O (pK<sub>a</sub> = 15.7) > NH<sub>3</sub> (pK<sub>a</sub> = 38) > CH<sub>4</sub> (pK<sub>a</sub> = 50)

> ④ **1-3.** **Mixed Effect**: As s-character increases, acidity increases

>> ○ **Hyperconjugation**

>>> ○ Definition: The phenomenon where sigma bonding provides electrons to anti pi bonding, stabilizing the compound.

>>> ○ In the order of sp ＞ sp<sup>2</sup> ＞ sp<sup>3</sup>, electronegativity is stronger, so sp<sup>3</sup> carbon provides electrons to sp and sp<sup>2</sup> carbon.

>> ○ Reason: In the order of sp ＞ sp<sup>2</sup> ＞ sp<sup>3</sup>, the spheric orbital, which is s character, is stronger, bringing it closer to the nucleus → increase in electronegativity.

>>> ○ sp Hybridization: Among 2 hybrid orbitals, 1 s orbital → 50 % s-character

>>> ○ sp<sup>2</sup> Hybridization: Among 3 hybrid orbitals, 1 s orbital → 33 % s-character

>>> ○ sp<sup>3</sup> Hybridization: Among 4 hybrid orbitals, 1 s orbital → 25 % s-character

>> ○ **Example 1.**

>>> ○ Basicity: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> > C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> > C<sub>2</sub>H<sup>-</sup>

>>> ○ Acidity: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> (pK<sub>a</sub> = ~50) < C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (pK<sub>a</sub> = 44) < C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> (pK<sub>a</sub> = 25)

>> ○ **Example 2.** Basicity: pyridine < piperidine

**Figure 18.** pyridine(top) and piperidine(bottom)

<br>

>>> ○ The N in pyridine is sp<sup>2</sup> and in piperidine is sp<sup>3</sup>, so H<sup>+</sup> is more likely to approach piperidine with smaller s-character.

>>> ○ The resonance stabilization in pyridine exists before and after the acid-base reaction, thus it is canceled out.

>>> ○ Basicity: alkyl amine (sp<sup>3</sup>) > pyridine (participating in resonance) > aniline (participating in resonance) > pyrrole (participating in resonance) > amide (participating in resonance)

>> ○ **Example 3.** Comparison of piperidinium and [aziridinium](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1414)

>> ○ **Example 4.** Influence of acidity by remote hybridization

>>> ○ propyl alcohol (pK<sub>a</sub>: 16.1), prop-2-en-1-ol (pK<sub>a</sub>: 15.5), benzenemethanol (pK<sub>a</sub>: 15.4), prop-2-yn-1-ol (pK<sub>a</sub>: 13.5) 

>>> ○ propanoic acid (pK<sub>a</sub>: 4.9), prop-2-enoic acid (pK<sub>a</sub>: 4.2), benzenemethanoic acid (pK<sub>a</sub>: 4.2), prop-2-ynoic acid (pK<sub>a</sub>: 1.9)

> ⑤ **1-4.** **Hydrogen Bonding:** Acidity increases when conjugate bases can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

>> ○ Example: _o_-aminophenol is more acidic than _p_-aminophenol.

<br>

**Figure 19.** Stabilization of _o_-aminophenol's conjugate base through hydrogen bonding

<br>

>> ○ Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding leads to weaker intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

> ⑥ **1-5.** Size Effect

>> ○ Larger polarization (∝ size) leads to better nucleophilicity, making overlap with σ* easier in the transition state.

>>> ○ Opposite to **2-2** explanation

>> ○ **Example 1.** Nucleophilicity: H<sub>2</sub>O ＜ H<sub>2</sub>S ＜ H<sub>2</sub>Se

>> ○ **Example 2.** Nucleophilicity: NH<sub>3</sub> ＜ PH<sub>3</sub>

> ⑦ **2-1.** **Resonance Stabilization Effect:** Resonance structures increase stability, reducing basicity.

>> ○ Multiple resonance contributors lead to energetic stability.

>> ○ [Particle in a box](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1329#4-particle-in-a-box-generally-particle-in-one-dimensional-box): Electron delocalization decreases energy (∝ 1 / L<sup>2</sup>).

>>> ○ Example: Carboxylic acid anion is stable and harmless due to resonance.

>> ○ Basicity: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>-</sup> > CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> (due to resonance stabilization)

>> ○ Acidity: CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH (pK<sub>a</sub> = 16) < CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (pK<sub>a</sub> = 5)

> ⑧ **2-2.** **Polarization:** More electron shells lead to reduced electron-electron repulsion, increasing stability and reducing basicity.

>> ○ Applicable mainly to HX compounds.

>> ○ Basicity: F<sup>-</sup> > Cl<sup>-</sup> > Br<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ Acidity: HF (pK<sub>a</sub> = 3.2) < HCl (pK<sub>a</sub> = -7) < HBr (pK<sub>a</sub> = -9)

> ⑨ **2-3.** **Backbonding:** p orbital electrons interact with vacant d orbitals, stabilizing the molecule.

>> ○ Example: Comparison of CHF<sub>3</sub> and CHCl<sub>3</sub>

>> ○ Acidity: CHF<sub>3</sub> < CHCl<sub>3</sub>

>> ○ Conjugate base stability: CF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> < CCl<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>

>> ○ Interpretation: Cl has 3d orbitals where electrons can be placed, thus excess electrons from carbon's 2p orbital can be stabilized by delocalizing in Cl's 3d orbitals.

>> ○ Electron-withdrawing inductive effect is stronger in CF<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> than CCl<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, which can be misleading about the stability of conjugate bases.

>> ○ Remember the trend of acidity: HF < HCl < HBr < HI, which makes understanding backbonding easier.

> ⑩ **2-4.** **Aromaticity Effect**

>> ○ A type of resonance stabilization effect.

>> ○ If the conjugate base possesses aromaticity, the special stabilization due to resonance leads to higher acidity.

>> ○ If the conjugate base is anti-aromatic, it's highly unstable, resulting in lower acidity.

> ⑪ **3-1.** **Steric Hindrance**

>> ○ Acidity: Ethanol (pK<sub>a</sub> = 16) > t-butanol (pK<sub>a</sub> = 18)

>> ○ Basicity: ethoxide < t-buthoxide

>> ○ If nucleophile is large, t-butoxide's steric hindrance can overcome its stabilization in solvent, leading to stronger nucleophilicity of ethoxide.

> ⑫ **3-2.** **Solvation Effect**

>> ○ Definition: The phenomenon where a separated conjugate base is stabilized by the surrounding solvent.

>> ○ Note: Basicity is not affected, only nucleophilicity is affected.

>> ○ Dielectric constant: Higher dielectric constants indicate stronger polarity, enhancing solvation effect.

>>> ○ Polar protic solvents (e.g., water) have higher dielectric constants compared to polar aprotic solvents (e.g., DMSO, DMF).

>> ○ Positive protic solvents: Easier stabilization with smaller-size electronegative atoms. Larger atoms have less electron density, leading to weaker ion-solvent interaction.

>>> ○ Basicity: I<sup>-</sup> < Br<sup>-</sup> < Cl<sup>-</sup> < F<sup>-</sup>

>>> ○ Nucleophilicity: I<sup>-</sup> > Br<sup>-</sup> > Cl<sup>-</sup> > F<sup>-</sup>

>>> ○ Basicity: SeH<sup>-</sup> < SH<sup>-</sup> < OH<sup>-</sup>

>>> ○ Nucleophilicity: SeH<sup>-</sup> > SH<sup>-</sup> > OH<sup>-</sup>

>>> ○ Basicity: _tert_-butoxide > ethoxide (due to steric hindrance)

>>> ○ I<sup>-</sup> is a good leaving group and nucleophile in water.

>>> ○ For elements in the same period, electronegativity dictates the trend. CH<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> > H<sub>2</sub>N<sup>-</sup> > HO<sup>-</sup> > F<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ Nonpolar aprotic solvents: Nucleophilicity follows the trend of basicity due to lack of intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

>>> ○ Basicity: I<sup>-</sup> < Br<sup>-</sup> < Cl<sup>-</sup> < F<sup>-</sup>

>>> ○ Nucleophilicity: I<sup>-</sup> < Br<sup>-</sup> < Cl<sup>-</sup> < F<sup>-</sup>

>>> ○ Basicity: SeH<sup>-</sup> < SH<sup>-</sup> < OH<sup>-</sup>

>>> ○ Nucleophilicity: SeH<sup>-</sup> < SH<sup>-</sup> < OH<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ I<sup>-</sup> shows increased basicity in protic solvents compared to nonpolar aprotic solvents.

>>> ○ Solvent hydrogen bonding increases basicity but reduces stability.
