## **2\. Phenomena Due to Water Vapor**

 ⑴ Three States of Water

> ① Latent Heat **:** Heat exchanged during a change of state without a temperature change.

> ② Evaporation **:** Conversion of water to water vapor, absorbs latent heat.

> ③ Condensation **:** Conversion of water vapor to water, releases latent heat.

> ④ Melting **:** Conversion of ice to water, absorbs latent heat.

> ⑤ Freezing **:** Conversion of water to ice, releases latent heat.

> ⑥ Water Cycle **:** The movement of water on Earth's surface and between the surface and the atmosphere through state changes.

 ⑵ **Temperature**

 ⑶ **Humidity**

> ① Condensation **:** When the amount of water vapor exceeds a certain limit, water droplets form.

> ② Nuclei for Condensation and Freezing

>> ○ Condensation Nuclei **:** Hygroscopic substances, etc.

>> ○ Ice Nuclei **:** Volcanic ash, soot, etc.

>> ○ Without condensation or ice nuclei, even in supersaturated conditions, condensation may not occur, creating a state of supersaturation.

> ③ Causes of Condensation (Cooling)

>> ○ Contact Cooling **:** Cooling that occurs when air contacts a cold surface or cold water.

>> ○ Mixing Cooling **:** Cooling that results from the mixing of warm and cold air.

>> ○ Radiative Cooling **:** Cooling due to nocturnal radiative heat loss.

>> ○ Adiabatic Cooling **:** Cooling due to the expansion of air as it rises.

>> ○ Adiabatic cooling has the greatest cooling effect.

> ④ Vapor Pressure

>> ○ Vapor Pressure **:** The pressure exerted by water vapor in the atmosphere, proportional to the amount of water vapor.

>> ○ Saturation Vapor Pressure **:** Vapor pressure of saturated water vapor in the atmosphere, proportional to temperature.

> ⑤ Relative Humidity **:** The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere relative to its saturation point at the current temperature (measured in %).

>> ○ A larger difference between temperature and dew point results in lower relative humidity.

>> ○ Relative humidity is 100% when temperature and dew point are equal.

>> ○ Relative Humidity = Current Vapor Pressure ÷ Saturation Vapor Pressure × 100 (%)

> ⑥ Absolute Humidity **:** The amount of water vapor in 1 m³ of natural air (moist air) expressed in g.

> ⑦ Dew Point Temperature **:** The temperature at which air would need to be cooled at constant pressure to reach saturation, causing condensation to form.

>> ○ Dew point temperature is the temperature where vapor pressure equals saturation vapor pressure.

>> ○ The dew point temperature is the same for air masses with equal vapor pressure.

> ⑧ Hygrometer

>> ○ Hair Hygrometer

>> ○ Dry and Wet Bulb Hygrometer

 ⑷ Adiabatic Changes, Adiabatic Lapse Rate

> ① Adiabatic Changes **:** Temperature changes in a rising or sinking air mass solely due to changes in volume.

>> ○ Adiabatic Expansion

>>> ○ As air rises, its volume expands due to decreased surrounding pressure, resulting in cooling.

>>> ○ Work is done against external air, causing the air mass to cool.

>> ○ Adiabatic Compression

>>> ○ As air sinks, its volume compresses due to increased surrounding pressure, resulting in warming.

>>> ○ Work is done by external air on the sinking air mass, causing it to warm.

> ② Adiabatic Lapse Rate **:** The rate of temperature change in an air mass as it rises or sinks adiabatically.

>> ○ Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate **:** The rate of temperature change for unsaturated air as it rises adiabatically.

>>> ○ 1 ℃ / 100 m

>> ○ Moist Adiabatic Lapse Rate **:** The rate of temperature change for saturated air as it rises adiabatically.

>>> ○ Due to latent heat release from condensation during ascent, it is lower than the dry adiabatic lapse rate.

>>> ○ 0.5 ℃ / 100 m

>> ○ Dew-Point Lapse Rate **:** The rate of dew point temperature change for unsaturated air as it rises.

>>> ○ Unsaturated Air: 0.2 ℃ / 100 m

>>> ○ Saturated Air: 0.5 ℃ / 100 m

>> ○ (Note) Formation of ice begins at 0 ℃.

>> ○ Example

**Figure 3.** Example of Adiabatic Lapse Rate 

>>> ○ Temperature at 800 m in ascent: 30 - 1 × 8 = 22 ℃

>>> ○ Temperature at 2,000 m in ascent: 22 - 0.5 × 12 = 16 ℃

>>> ○ Temperature at point B in descent: 16 + 1 × 20 = 36 ℃

 ⑸ Clouds

> ① Cloud Formation

>> ○ Cloud **:** Water vapor in the air undergoes adiabatic cooling, leading to the presence of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the sky.

>> ○ Cloud Formation Process **:** Air rising → Volume expansion → Adiabatic cooling → Cloud formation

>> ○ Growth of Ice Crystals **:** Ice crystals adhere to supercooled water droplets due to higher **saturation vapor pressure** of water droplets compared to ice.

>>> ○ Below 0 ℃, supercooled water droplets coexist with ice crystals.

>>> ○ Air in the cloud is unsaturated with respect to supercooled water droplets.

>>> ○ Air in the cloud is supersaturated with respect to ice crystals.

> ② Level of Condensation

>> ○ As unsaturated air rises

>>> ○ The air mass cools at a rate of 1 ℃ / 100 m due to the dry adiabatic lapse rate, and the dew point decreases at a rate of 0.2 ℃ / 100 m.

>>> ○ Consider the change along the temperature line.

>> ○ As the air mass rises, the difference between temperature and dew point decreases until they become equal at the condensation level, where relative humidity reaches 100%, leading to cloud formation.

>> ○ Condensation Level (m) = 125 × (Surface Temperature - Dew Point)

>>> ○ Typhoons often coincide with spring tides
