## **1\. Romanov family**

⑴ In 1918, communists (Bolsheviks, Lenin) executed families and servants of the ruling Roman Romanov family (300 years of history) and buried their bodies in the abandoned mines of Yekaterinburg.

> ① Alexis, who would then succeed the emperor, was suffering from hemophilia. The empress was dedicated to the prince's health and thus made various mistakes. His disease also served as a cause for which he would not succeed the emperor.

⑵ The fall of the Soviet Communist regime in 1991.

⑶ In 1991, as part of efforts to end the Soviet communist regime, the movement advocating for a proper royal funeral grew louder.

⑷ How can we determine who is who among the nine remains buried in an abandoned mine in Yekaterinburg?

## **2\. Forensic evidence**

⑴ Overview

> ① Forensic Medicine: Deals with medical issues related to the law and falls under the subspecialty of pathology, specifically "autopsy."  

> ② In 1965, British geneticist Alec Jeffreys first introduced DNA analysis into forensic medicine.

> ③ **While studying human genes, he accidentally discovered a repeating sequence of 33 base pairs, which he named "minisatellite DNA."

⑵ Forensic evidence

> ① External evidence of the exhumed body

>> ○ The exhumed body was severely damaged, making it impossible to find fingerprints or footprints.

>> ○ There was no evidence of toxic substances (circumstantial inference).

> ②  Personal belongings of the exhumed body

>> ○ Items such as gold and porcelain suggest the individual was of noble status.

> ③ Evidence of bone

>> ○ 6 adults and 3 children according to bones.

>> ○ The pelvic bone had decayed, making it impossible to determine the sex.

>> ○ Superimposing royal family records and bone photographs using electromagnetic imaging matched the remains to the emperor, empress, three of their five children, and four servants (circumstantial inference).

> ④ DNA fingerprinting

⑶ Questions at the time of the first excavation

> ① Why are there only three children's remains out of the five siblings?

> ② For health reasons, his son Alexis would have died. Is the last princess Anastasia alive?

> ③ After that, Anna Anderson insisted that she was Anastasia..

## **3\. Romanov's appearance and genotype**

⑴ Wavy Hair (C) and Straight Hair (c), Black Eyes (D) and Blue Eyes (d)

> ① Wavy hair is dominant over straight hair.  

> ② Black eyes are dominant over blue eyes.  

> ③ The genes for hair texture and eye color are not linked → Mendel's law of independence applies.

⑵ Emperor: Straight Hair (cc), Black Eyes (D_)

⑶ Empress: Wavy Hair (C_), Black Eyes (D_)

⑷ Wavy Hair (C_), Black Eyes (D_): Tatiana, Maria

⑸ Wavy Hair (C_), Blue Eyes (dd): Anastasia, Olga

⑹ Straight Hair (cc), Blue Eyes (dd): Alexis

⑺ Emperor (ccDd), Empress (CcDc)

> ① Since the recessive eye color trait (blue eyes) appeared in the offspring of the emperor and empress, the empress must be a carrier. → Emperor: **cc**, Empress: **Cc**  

> ② Since the recessive hair texture trait (straight hair) appeared in their offspring, both the emperor and empress must be carriers. → Emperor: **Dd**, Empress: **Dd**

## **5\. Romanov royal family and DNA fingerprint**

⑴ [DNA fingerprinting](https://jb243.github.io/pages/77#4-dna-fingerprinting)

⑵ The nine individuals in the Yekaterinburg grave have distinct DNA fingerprints.

⑶ Romanov families seem to be more similar in bands than servants.

⑷ Royal children's bands must match at least one parent's band.

> ① Because the chromosomes of royal children are either paternal or maternal.

⑸ Identified as the emperor and empress (adults 1 and 3), three daughters (children 1, 2, and 3), and four servants (adults 2, 4, 5, and 6).

## **6\. Fingerprint contrast with Romanov pedigree**

⑴ Comparing the DNA fingerprints of the relatives of the emperor and the empress to confirm the Romanov family.

⑵ The bone of the adult male related to the children was related to Emperor's brother George.

⑶ The bone of the adult woman related to the children was linked to Philip, the great-nephew of the empress.

⑷ Conclusion: The tomb contains the emperor, the empress, three children, and four servants.

⑸ Anastasia and Alexis' remains were found in further excavations.
