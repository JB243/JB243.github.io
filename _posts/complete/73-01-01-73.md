## **1\. Romanov family**

⑴ In 1918, communists (Bolsheviks, Lenin) executed families and servants of the ruling Roman Romanov family (300 years of history) and buried their bodies in the abandoned mines of Yekaterinburg.

> ① Alexis, who would then succeed the emperor, was suffering from hemophilia. The empress was dedicated to the prince's health and thus made various mistakes.. His disease also served as a cause for which he would not succeed the emperor..

⑵ The fall of the Soviet Communist regime in 1991

⑶ In 1991, the voice of the movement to raise the right funeral of the royal family for the purpose of liquidating the Soviet Communist regime became louder.

⑷ How do you know who is out of nine remains buried in the abandoned mines in Yekaterinburg?

## **2\. Forensic evidence**

⑴ Forensic science **:** Targets medical problems related to law 

⑵ Forensic evidence

> ① Excavation dead body evidence

>> ○ Excavation body damage was so severe that fingerprints and foot prints could not be found.

>> ○ No evidence of poison (cardiopathy)

> ② A collection of excavated bodies

>> ○ Presumably aristocratic with gold, magnetic products, etc.

> ③ Evidence of bone

>> ○ 6 adults and 3 children

>> ○ Pelvic bones decay

>> ○ Electromagnetic overlay of royal records and bones **:** Emperor, Empress, 3 of 5 children, 4 servants (cardiac)

> ④ DNA fingerprinting

⑶ Questions at the time of the first excavation

> ① Why are three children's remains of five children?

> ② For health reasons, his son Alexis would have died.. Is the last princess Anastasia alive?

> ③ Anna Anderson insisted that she was Anastasia..

<br>

## **3\. Romanov's appearance and genotype**

⑴ Tetanus (C) and Straight Hair (c), Black Eyes (D), and Blue Eyes (d)

> ① Papillary hair is dominant against straight hair

> ② Black Eyes Dominate Against Blue Eyes

> ③ Head and eye color genes are not related → Mendel's law of independence

⑵ Emperor **:** Straight Hair (cc), Black Eyes (D\_), Empress **:** Wavy Hair (C\_), Black Eyes (D\_)

⑶ Tetanus (C\_), Black Eyes (D\_) **:** Tatiana, Maria

⑷ Tetanus (C\_), Blue Eyes (dd) **:** Anastasia, Olga

⑸ Straight Hair (cc), Blue Eyes (dd) **:** Alexis

⑹ Emperor (ccDd), Empress (CcDc)

> ① Empress X is the carrier of the emperor ×

>> ○ **∴** Emperor cc, Empress Cc

> ② Emperor × Empress showed recessive traits (hair) of hair, so both Emperor and Empress showed

>> ○ **∴** Emperor Dd, Empress Dd

## **4\. Romanov and hemophilia : Why did Alexis have hemophilia?**

## **5\. Romanov royal family and DNA fingerprint**

⑴ DNA fingerprinting

⑵ Nine of Yekaterinburg's tombs have different DNA fingerprints.

⑶ Romanov families seem to be more similar in bands than servants

⑷ Royal children's bands must match at least one parent's band.

> ① The chromosomes of royal children are either paternal or maternal.

⑸ Emperor and Empress (adults 1, 3), 3 daughters (child 1, 2, 3), 4 servants (adults 2, 4, 5, 6)

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Fingerprint contrast with Romanov pedigree**

⑴ Comparing the DNA fingerprints of the relatives of the emperor and the empress to confirm the Romanov family

⑵ Adult male bones (associated with children) were related to Emperor's brother George.

⑶ Adult female bones (associated with children) were associated with Philip's nephew, grandson.

⑷ Conclusion **:** The tomb contains the emperor, the empress, three children, and four servants..

⑸ Anastasia and Alexis' remains were found in further excavations..
