## **4\. Experimental Techniques**

⑴ Recrystallization: Utilizes solubility differences

> ① **Step 1:** Heat the solution until it melts, then slowly cool

>> ○ Slow cooling prevents supercooling

> ② **Step 2:** Wait for crystals to form

>> ○ Providing seed crystals: If no crystals form, scrape the walls of the beaker with a glass rod

> ③ **Step 3:** Filtration using vacuum filtration apparatus (e.g., Büchner funnel)

> ④ **Case 1:** Precipitate is washed with EtOH, dried, and weighed: If interested in the precipitate

>> ○ Why sprinkle a small amount of solvent onto the crystals?: To remove impurities on the crystal surface

> ⑤ **Case 2:** Solvent extraction using a vacuum rotary evaporator: If interested in the solution

> ⑥ Good solvents exhibit significant changes in solubility with temperature

⑵ Liquid-Liquid Extraction: Utilizes polarity differences

> ① Generally employs a separatory funnel

> ② Addition of NaCl increases the ionic strength of the aqueous layer, facilitating separation between the organic and aqueous layers

⑶ Fractional Distillation: Utilizes boiling point differences

**Figure 2.** TLC Chromatography (left) and Column Chromatography (right)

<br>

> ① **Type 1:** Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC): Used to monitor the progress of reactions

>> ○ Principle: Interaction difference between the sample and silica gel

>> ○ Purpose: Confirm reaction progress, determine reaction completion

>> ○ Normal Phase Silica Gel: Strongly polar. Higher affinity with increasing sample polarity

>> ○ Stationary Phase is silica gel (most polar), Mobile Phase is developing solvent (non-polar)

>> ○ Definition of R<sub>f</sub>: Distance moved by sample ÷ Distance moved by solvent

>> ○ Comparison of R<sub>f</sub> for different compounds

>>> ○ Acid, Base, Metal salt ＜ Carboxylic acid, Amine, Amide ＜ Alcohol ＜ Aldehyde, Ketone ＜ Alkyl halide ＜ Ester ＜ Alkene ＜ Alkane ＜ Alkyne

>>> ○ **Trend 1:** Higher sample polarity leads to stronger interaction with silica gel, resulting in smaller Rf

>>> ○ **Trend 2:** Amino and hydroxy groups are less polar than nitro, but due to hydrogen bonding, their Rf is smaller

>>> ○ **Trend 3:** _trans_ Alkenes have smaller Rf than _cis_ Alkenes (because of stronger interaction)

>>> ○ Example: Rf in Paper Chromatography and Chlorophyll Separation Experiment: Carotinoids > Xanthophyll > Chlorophyll a > Chlorophyll b

>> ○ Comparison of R<sub>f</sub> with organic solvents

>>> ○ Water ＜ Acetic acid ＜ Alcohol ＜ Ethyl Acetate ＜ CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> ＜ Toluene ＜ CCl<sub>4</sub> ＜ n-Hexane

>>> ○ **Trend 1:** Higher polarity of the developing solvent leads to increased R<sub>f</sub>

>>> ○ Ethyl Acetate: Representative polar solvent

>>> ○ _n_-Hexane: Representative non-polar solvent

② **Type 2:** Column Chromatography: Used for separation of mixtures

>> ○ TLC can be thought of as a simplified chromatography

>> ○ **Factor 1:** Faster migration with weaker interactions in the column: Columns are generally polar

>> ○ **Factor 2:** Faster migration with stronger interactions with the developing solvent: Developing solvent is non-polar

>> ○ Non-polar substances migrate faster. Gravity has little relevance

⑸ Qualitative Analysis: Uses visible characteristics for identification of specific functional groups in organic compounds

> ① Br<sub>2</sub>: Reddish-brown solution

>> ○ Bleaching Reaction: Halogenation reaction results in colorless product

> ② FeCl<sub>3</sub>(_aq_): Yellow solution

>> ○ Reacts with phenol to form Fe(OPh)<sub>3</sub>, producing color change (burgundy)

>> ○ Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub>: Green rust

>> ○ Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>: Dark orange

> ③ AgNO<sub>3</sub>(_aq_): Colorless solution

>> ○ Forms white precipitate AgCl if halide is Cl<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ Forms yellow precipitate AgI if halide is I<sup>-</sup>

> ④ KMnO<sub>4</sub>(_aq_): Purple solution

>> ○ Forms brown precipitate MnO<sub>2</sub>

> ⑤ AgNO<sub>3</sub>, KOH, NH<sub>4</sub>OH or Ag<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>4</sub>OH: Colorless solution

>> ○ Silver mirror reaction or Tollens test: It does not react with ketones but reacts with aldehydes to precipitate metallic silver.

>> ○ Ag<sub>2</sub>O acts as an Ag<sup>+</sup> donor: Oxygen in water migrates to aldehydes, forming carboxylic acids.

**Figure 3.** Silver mirror reaction or Tollens test 

<br>

> ⑥ Concentrated HCl, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>: Colorless solution

>> ○ Reacts with alcohols to form alkyl chlorides, resulting in a cloudy solution or layer separation

>> ○ In alcohol's S<sub>N</sub>1 addition reactions, Cl<sup>-</sup> is less reactive than other nucleophiles like OH-, hence a catalyst like ZnCl<sub>2</sub> is needed

> ⑦ Silver (Ag)

>> ○ Reacts with hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) to form black silver sulfide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S) precipitate

> ⑧ Chromium (Cr)

>> ○ K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is orange, Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> is bluish-green

>> ○ K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is used as an oxidizing agent, often used to measure COD

> ⑨ Ammonium Chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl)

>> ○ Reaction of gaseous HCl and NH<sub>3</sub> results in a white ring

⑹ Optical Resolution

> ① Converts racemic mixtures into partial stereoisomers using specific absolute configuration optical isomers

> ② Different physical properties allow for separation

> ③ **Application 1:** Acid-Base Reaction: Strong acid or base added to separate ions in the reaction product and additive

> ④ **Application 2:** Mirror Image Chromatography
