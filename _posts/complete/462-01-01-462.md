## **1\. The classification of the brain cross section**

⑴ Horizontal plane(transverse plane)**:** It distinguishes the "rostral"(superior) direction from the "caudal"(inferior) direction.

> ① It is frequently used in the medical imaging instrument.

> ② In MRI, the horizontal plane is called "axial plane".

> ③ The vertical direction of the horizontal plane is set to z-axis ('up' is '+' and 'down' is '-').

⑵ Coronal plane(frontal plane)**:** It distinguishes the "ventral"(anterior) direction from the "dorsal"(posterior) direction. 

> ① It is frequently used in anatomy.

> ② The vertical direction of the coronal plane is set to y-axis ('front' is '+' and 'back' is '-').

⑶ Sagittal plan) : It distinguishes the "medial" direction from the "lateral" direction; also the left from the right. 

> ① "Midsagittal plane" is equal to the "median plane".

> ② The vertical direction of the sagittal plane is set to x-axis ('right' is '+' and 'left' is '-').

## **2\. The standard of the cross section image**

⑴ RBL(Reid's base line, frankfurt line) 

> ① The anatomical base line 

> ② The weakness is that it can't be used in CT(computer tomography).

⑵ CML(canthomeatal line) 

> ① External range mark and canthus-meatal line to make the angle (by which the cross section is cut in CT) constant. 

> ② "Lateral canthus" is one end and "external auditory canal" is the other end. 

⑶ CIL(central intercommissural line) : AC(anterior commissure) is one end and PC(posterior commissure) is the other end. CIL is used in MRI with which the inside of the brain can be seen. 

> ① In average, the American distance between AC and PC is 28 mm. 

⑷  TIL(tangential intercommissural line) 

> ① It is the base line which had been used as the standard before CIL was adopted as the standard.  

> ② The upper boundary of AC is one end and the lower boundary of PC is the other end. 

> ③ Schaltenbrandt (1977) and Talairach (1988) developed TIL considerably. 

> ④ Now, TIL is still in use in Talairach Atlas, one of the brain standards, and MNI(Montreal imaging institute) template that is used in fMRI.

## **3\. The positioning of the brain and the setting of the coordinates**

⑴ Stereotaxy**:** It is the method by which the location of a certain structure in the brain can be determined.

⑵ Zero point**:** The midpoint of AC and PC 

⑶ RAU(reference adjusted unit) (mm)**:** The conversed size unit of the sample brain based on the reference brain. RAU is used in MR image. 

> ① Conversion factor**:** The size of the sample brain / the size of the reference brain  

⑷ Example**:** The location of "red nucleus" are C(coronal)-8, S(sagittal)-8, A(axial)-6.
