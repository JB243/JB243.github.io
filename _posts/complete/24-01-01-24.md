## **1\. Step 1.** (Preparation) Opening Ports

⑴ Port

> ① A channel through which requests are sent from a lower node

> ② [Inbound Traffic](https://fishpoint.tistory.com/6595#:~:text=and%20outbound%20traffic-) **:** Traffic coming into the server

>> ○ Example: In the case of a client uploading a file to the server, there is inbound traffic from the server's perspective

>> ○ Inbound traffic is mostly blocked by routers, so ports need to be opened

>> ○ When opening ports, the source is the client, and the destination is the server (router), ultimately opened on the server side

> ③ [Outbound Traffic](https://fishpoint.tistory.com/6595#:~:text=%EA%B7%B8%EB%A6%BC%20%EB%8F%99%EC%98%81%EC%83%81%20%EC%97%85%EB%A1%9C%EB%93%9C)- **:** Traffic going out from the server

>> ○ Example: In the case of the server sending a file to the client, there is outbound traffic from the server's perspective

>> ○ Outbound traffic is almost always open on routers

>> ○ For example, when a client downloads a file from the server, it's a typical outbound traffic scenario

> ④ Both the server and the router have port numbers

⑵ Port Opening Method

> ① When sending traffic from one node to another, the receiving node needs to have its port opened as it becomes inbound traffic

⑶ **Step 1.** Port Forwarding

> ① Changing port numbers on the router for each server **:** Sometimes referred to as port opening

>> ○ Example: If a user connects on port 1234 and the Linux computer only allows connections on port 22 (default port), the port number can be changed to allow connection

>> ○ Some routers allow setting for all IP addresses, while others do not

⑷ **Step 2.** Opening Ports in the Computer Room

> ① For security reasons, certain predefined ports (e.g., RDP port, 3389) are closed in the computer room

> ② In such cases, inquire with the computer room to open the required port

> ③ If a different port is opened instead, [use regedit to change the remote access port number of the server computer](https://apophis0.tistory.com/49)

> ④ If a different port is opened instead, the port needs to be opened in **Step 1**

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Step 2.** (Preparation) Closed Port Method

⑴ Closed Port Method

> ① After setting up a relay server in the middle, only outbound traffic is received from users, so port opening is not required

⑵ **Example 1.** TeamViewer

> ① Login-based remote access program

> ② Works similarly to VPN, but it is not using VPN

> ③ Might use a different protocol than RDP

> ④ However, TeamViewer, which uses a 6-letter password, has poor security to the extent that it can be hacked using brute-force methods

⑶ **Example 2.** Google Chrome Remote Desktop

⑷ **Example 3.** Zoom

⑸ **Example 4.** Google Meet

⑹ **Example 5.** Duo

⑺ **Example 6.** AnyDesk

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Step 3.** (Intermediate Process) VPN Configuration

⑴ VPN (Virtual Private Network)

> ① Private network established with security to allow specific authorized users to enter the network

> ② VPN may need to be turned on and off, and internet speed might slightly decrease

> ③ Even with a VPN, port opening is generally required

> ④ Using a VPN can bypass connection blocks by the server on blocked IP addresses

> ⑤ Example: Mareel VPN

⑵ **Example 1.** WireGuard

⑶ **Example 2.** Tailscale **:** UI overlay on top of WireGuard protocol

> ① Overview

>> ○ **Advantage 1.** Free accounts can register up to 20 devices

>> ○ **Advantage 2.** Low security concerns

> ② **Step 1.** Install Tailscale on the server and log in

> ③ **Step 2.** Install Tailscale on personal computer and log in with the same account

> ④ **Step 3.** Go to the Tailscale website and log in to check the VPN internal IP for each device

> ⑤ **Step 4.** Connect my computer to the server

>> ○ **Case 1.** Server RDP connection

>> ○ **Case 2.** SSH connection from my computer

⑷ **Example 3.** [wg-easy](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-easy) **:** Open-source project with included UI

⑸ **Example 4.** Implementation through Windows-provided VPN

> ① Can be done using IPTIME

> ② The server computer should have Windows password lock

<br>

<br>

## **4. Step 4.** (Required Application Installation) RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

⑴ Overview

> ① Remote connection with GUI support

> ② Concurrent connections are limited

> ③ RDP does not work on Windows Home Edition

⑵ **Step 1.** Installing RDP (Linux-specific, Required)

> ① RDP server and client are both built-in Windows features, no separate installation required, simple configuration needed

> ② Since RDP is a Microsoft protocol, it requires separate installation of server and client on Linux

⑶ **Step 2.** Connecting the Client and Windows Server (Required)

> ① Windows-to-Windows server connection is well supported natively due to RDP being Windows-based

> ② Mac-to-Windows server connection is done through Microsoft Remote Desktop

> ③ RDP default port number is 3389

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Step 5.** (Required Application Installation) SSH (Secure Shell)

⑴ Overview

> ① Terminal-based remote connection

⑵ **Step 1.** Installing [Windows SSH server](https://techexpert.tips/ko/windows-ko/windows-ssh-서버-설치/) **:** Compare with Step 2 and Step 3 for selection

> ① Many Linux OS like Ubuntu come with SSH server and client pre-installed and configured

> ② Unlike Ubuntu, installing SSH on Windows is difficult

> ③ SSH server and SSH client need to be considered separately

⑶ **Step 2.** Installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) **:** Compare with Step 1 and Step 3 for selection

> ① WSL is like virtualization within Windows, different from dual OS setup

> ② WSL is advantageous for managing environment variables and paths in Python development

> ③ [Installation Tutorial](https://kimsungjin.tistory.com/590)

⑷ **Step 3.** Dual OS Installation **:** Compare with Step 1 and Step 2 for selection

⑸ **Step 4.** Checking if SSH is open on the remote server

⑹ **Step 5.** Installing VScode Remote-SSH on personal computer (client)

[Link 2](https://technote.kr/320#subject2)) **:** Required

> ① Remote-SSH is Microsoft's official software with guaranteed performance

> ② By entering the server address and connecting, you can develop on your personal computer remotely with server resources and development environment intact

⑺ **Step 6.** Disabling password login and setting up RSA key login only **:** Optional for enhanced security

> ① To enhance security

⑻ **Step 7.** SSH can be made easier to use through software like Mobaxterm (free), PuTTY, etc.

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Step 6.** (Other Application Installation) Wake on LAN (WOL)

⑴ Software to turn on and off remotely **:** Provides power function in LAN, making it possible

⑵ Many routers support WOL, so it's easy to turn on using a smartphone app when configured correctly

⑶ Servers on VPN without physical connection cannot be turned on or off using WOL

⑷ Generally, server lifespan is several years if overheating issues are absent, so WOL might not be necessary

<br>

<br>

## **7\. Step 7.** Server Computer Management

⑴ Turning off the monitor is recommended to avoid burn-in

⑵ Windows Desktop Protocol allows concurrent connections, but since it shares a single GUI, it is realistically possible for only one person to use it at a time.
