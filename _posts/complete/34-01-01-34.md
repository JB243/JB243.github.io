## **3\. Concept of Phasors**  

 ⑴ [Laplace Transform](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1910): Easily interprets all systems

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Problems related to instantaneous voltage, current, and power are transformed into expressions for **V**, **I**, **P**, etc., using Laplace transforms

>> ○ Instantaneous Voltage: Voltage measured at a specific moment. Represented as v(t)

>> ○ Instantaneous Current: Current measured at a specific moment. Represented as i(t)

>> ○ Instantaneous Power: Product of voltage and current measured at a specific moment. Represented as p(t)

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Solve for **V**, **I**, **P**, etc., separately

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Obtain solutions in the desired form by calculating the inverse Laplace transform of **V**, **I**, **P**, resulting in v(t), i(t), p(t)

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Equations involving 's' correspond to Laplace transforms ↔ Equations involving 'jω' correspond to phasor equations

<br>

 ⑵ Phasors (Complex form, phasor): Representation of steady-state sinusoidal quantities using complex numbers

> ① Introduction: Complex numbers have a powerful visualization tool called the complex plane

> ② Premise: For v(t) = A cos(ωt + θ),

>> ○ Consider it as the real part of a complex number called phasor

>> ○ ωt is common, so it can be ignored

> ③ Representation of complex quantities

>> ○ Rectangular coordinate system: z = x + jy

>> ○ Polar coordinate system: z = r∠θ○ Equation of a circle: z = rejθ

<br>

 ⑶ Laplace transforms can be applied to all systems, but phasors can only be used in AC circuits

> ① Complex forms are not applicable, and there are examples where only Laplace transforms are used

> ② Example: Circuits using both DC and AC voltages in electromagnetic wave oscillators

<br>

<br>

>> ○ Admittance = Conductance + j × Susceptance

>> ○ **Conductance**: Real part of admittance

>> ○ **Susceptance**: Imaginary part of admittance

<br>

>> ○ Energy stored in coils and capacitors is not actually used

>>> ○ Reactive power is the amount of energy that doesn't get fully utilized by the circuit as it returns to the power source while the electrons circulate

>>> ○ Positive reactive power in an inductor: Electrical energy is converted to magnetic field energy

>>> ○ Negative reactive power in an inductor: Magnetic field energy is converted to electrical energy

>> ○ Reactive power increases real power

>>> ○ Reactance generates reactive power and reduces the power factor

>>> ○ Reduced power factor requires more current to perform the same work

>>> ○ More current flowing leads to increased energy loss (real power) through resistors

> ⑤ Power factor: cos θ (where θ: phase difference between current and voltage) represents it

>> ○ Length of the hypotenuse × cos θ = Length of the base

>> ○ Magnitude of a complex number × cos θ = Real value

>> ○ Magnitude of the apparent power × cos θ = Magnitude of the effective value

>> ○ |Effective power| ÷ |Apparent power| = cos(θv \- θi)

>> ○ (Note) Reactive power factor: |Reactive power| ÷ |Apparent power| = sin(θv \- θi)

>> ○ Negative resistance does not exist in circuits, so cos(θv \- θi) is never negative.
