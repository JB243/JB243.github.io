## **1\. Streak Plate Method** (streak plate)

⑴ Definition **:** Method used for isolating a single colony

⑵ Procedure

**Figure. 1.** Streak Plate Method Procedure

<br>

<br>

## **2. [Gram Staining](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1021)**

⑴ Gram Staining **:** Staining technique developed by Gram

⑵ Gram Staining **:** Crystal violet → Safranine O

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Heat bacterial cells on a slide glass using an alcohol lamp for 2-3 times for fixation

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Sprinkle Crystal Violet stain reagent on the sample with Crystal Violet, let it sit for 20 seconds

>> ○ All cells are violet at this point

>> ○ Crystal Violet, being a positively charged basic dye, binds strongly to the teichoic acid of Gram-positive bacteria's peptidoglycan

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Wash off the stain with distilled water in a tube for a short time and remove excess water

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. Sprinkle Iodine solution (I2-KI) on the sample with Iodine, let it sit for 1 minute

>> ○ Iodine forms a complex with crystal violet preventing decolorization (mordant function)

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. Dip the slide in a tube with 95% EtOH and remove it, washing off the Iodine solution

>> ○ Only Gram-positive bacteria retain the violet color

>> ○ In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, alcohol contracts the cell wall, trapping I2-crystal violet within the cytoplasm

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup>. Dip the slide gently in a tube with distilled water to stop the decolorization

> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup>. Sprinkle Safranine on the sample, let it sit for 1 minute

>> ○ Gram-positive bacteria maintain the violet color

>> ○ Gram-negative bacteria appear red due to Safranine

> ⑧ 8<sup>th</sup>. Rinse gently with water for a few seconds, then remove excess water

⑶ Gram-positive bacteria

> ① Structure **:** Cytoplasm - Cell membrane - Thick peptidoglycan layer

> ② [Peptidoglycan](http://nate9389.tistory.com/1389) **:** Alternating N-acetylglucosamine (N-AG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (N-AM) with β 1→4 linkage

> ③ Form endospores for high-temperature and high-pressure resistance

> ④ Teichoic acid protrudes from peptidoglycan and is connected by covalent bonding, observed only in Gram-positive

>> ○ Teichoic acid contains glycotamine and carries a negative charge

> ⑤ Examples **:** Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus

⑷ Gram-negative bacteria

> ① Structure **:** Cytoplasm - Cell membrane - Periplasmic space - Thin peptidoglycan - Periplasmic space - LPS, Outer membrane

> ② LPS (lipopolysaccharide) **:** Toxic and an immune system target

>> ○ Toxicity of botulinum toxin is derived from LPS

>> ○ Penicillin cannot pass through LPS

>> ○ Blood clotting, fever

> ③ Outer membrane **:** More permeable than cell membrane due to porins

> ④ Periplasmic space

>> ○ Separates peptidoglycan layer, cell membrane, and outer membrane

>> ○ Important cellular space for metabolism and material transport

> ⑤ Examples **:** Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori

## **3\. Antibiotic Susceptibility Test** (AST)

⑴ Overview

> ① CFU (colony forming unit) **:** Number of colonies formed by bacteria or fungal spores in a sample

>> ○ Formula can be used if necessary **:** Sample's CFU = CFU of diluted sample × dilution factor

> ② MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) **:** Minimum concentration of an antibiotic that inhibits microbial growth

> ③ MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) **:** Minimum concentration at which no microorganisms appear even after subculture on a nutrient medium

>> ○ Essentially, the minimum concentration at which bacteria are killed

>> ○ MBC ≤ MIC

> ④ Can provide information about the bacteria's identity

⑵ Broth Dilution Test (Broth Microdilution Method)

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Different concentrations of antibiotics added to microorganisms with the same CFU

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. MIC determination **:** Determine the lowest antibiotic concentration that doesn't cause visual turbidity after overnight incubation

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. MBC determination **:** Determine the lowest antibiotic concentration at which no colonies appear after subculture on a nutrient medium

> ④ Limited by using optical density

⑶ Disc Diffusion Method

> ① Measure the diameter of the inhibition zone caused by the drug

⑷ Epsilometer Test

> ① Measure MIC directly and conveniently by establishing a gradient of antibiotic concentrations within a single plate

> ② Cannot measure MBC

⑸ SCMA (Single-Cell Morphological Analysis)

> ① Problem **:** Highly dependent on initial bacterial concentration when measuring MIC in blood samples

> ② MIC can be easily determined using an optical microscope

<br>

## **4\. Ames Test**

⑴ Overview

> ① Genetic toxicity assessment method developed by Dr. Bruce Ames' team at the University of California, Berkeley

> ② Used to identify mutagenic and carcinogenic agents **:** Shows a strong correlation with carcinogenicity test results, quick and simple

> ③ Commonly used for screening before phase 1 of drug development

> ④ Verify if reversion mutation occurs using auxotrophic mutations

>> ○ Reversion mutation **:** Requires the same mutation mechanism, typically a point mutation

> ⑤ Uses Salmonella typhimurium sensitive to mutagens

> ⑥ Colonies decrease when using strains with normal DNA repair functions

> ⑦ Commonly used test strains

>> ○ Salmonella typhimurium TA98

>> ○ Salmonella typhimurium TA100

>> ○ Salmonella typhimurium TA1535

>> ○ Salmonella typhimurium TA1537

>> ○ Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA (pKM101)

⑵ Experimental Process

> ① Prepare mutant strains of S. typhimurium for each strain

> ③ Culture on minimal medium agar and spread them

> ④ Place discs with the following on the agar's center

>> ○ Water: Negative control

>> ○ Enzyme: Negative control

>> ○ Chemical substance: Experimental group

>> ○ Water + Enzyme: Negative control

>> ○ Chemical substance + Enzyme: If colony count is similar to the experiment group treated solely with the chemical substance, then the chemical substance is a mutagen on its own

> ④ Cultivate at 37°C for 16 hours

> ⑤ If colonies appear, it indicates no nutritional requirements and reversion mutations occurred

## **5\. Cross-Feeding Experiment**

⑴ Overview **:** Experiment to determine the sequence of metabolic actions

⑵ Premises

> ① Mutant A has a mutation in gene a, B has a mutation in gene b, C has a mutation in gene c

>> ○ For convenience, let's denote the substance produced by gene x as X

> ② Intermediate substances of proline biosynthesis that mutants unable to synthesize proline accumulate within the cell

> ③ Accumulated proline biosynthesis intermediate substances diffuse through a single medium

⑶ Results

**Figure. 4.** Experiment for temperature dependency assessment

⑷ Interpretation

> ① Interpretation of the 22°C experiment

>> ○ Substance C acts later than substance A **:** ?? → Substance A → Substance C, Strain A survives because enzyme c is present

>> ○ Strain B has nutritional requirements

> ② Interpretation of the 30°C experiment

>> ○ Strain B has nutritional requirements

>> ○ Strain C has nutritional requirements

>> ○ According to premise ②, strain C doesn't accumulate substances, hence there's no substance transferred to strain A

> ③ Interpretation of the 42°C experiment

>> ○ Strain B has nutritional requirements **:** Strain B is temperature-sensitive

>> ○ Substance A acts later than substance B **:** ?? → Substance B → Substance A, Strain B survives because enzyme a is present

>> ○ Strain C has nutritional requirements

 ⑸ Interpretation Know-How

> ① The more delayed the enzyme's action, the more serious the mutation

> ② Experiment at 22°C shows Substance A → Substance C

> ③ Experiment at 42°C shows Substance B → Substance C
