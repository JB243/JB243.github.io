## **1. Basics**

⑴ Components of a graph **:** Node V, Edge E, Graph G

> ① V(G) = {v<sub>1</sub>, ···, v<sub>n</sub>}

> ② v<sub>i</sub> ~ v<sub>j</sub>: When edge e<sub>ij</sub> connects vertices v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>. 

⑵ Degree of Graph G **:** Number of nodes, i.e., |V(G)|

⑶ Size of Graph G **:** Number of edges, i.e., |E(G)|

⑷ Degree of node v **:** Number of edges connected to node v, i.e., deg(v). 

> ① deg(v<sub>i</sub>) = ∑<sub>v<sub>i</sub>~v<sub>j</sub></sub> 1

> ② δ(G) refers to the minimum degree of nodes in G, and Δ(G) refers to the maximum degree of nodes in G.

> ③ ∑ deg(v<sub>i</sub>) = 2 | E(G) |

> ④ If all the nodes of a graph have the same degree, the graph is regular.

> ⑤ The nodes of an Eulerian graph have even degree.

⑸ Simple graph and complete graph

> ① Simple graph **:** A graph in which at most one edge exists between any two nodes, and self-loops (edges connecting a node to itself) are not allowed.

> ② Complete graph **:** A graph in which all nodes are connected by **unique** edges.

**Figure 2.** Complete Graph

<br>

> ③ strongly connected **:** A state where any node i can reach any other node j within the graph.

> ④ The number of edges in a complete graph is <sub>N</sub>C<sub>2</sub> = N(N-1) / 2.

⑹ Walk **:** A path like v<sub>0</sub> → v<sub>1</sub> → ... → v<sub>m</sub>, connected by edges v<sub>0</sub>v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>m-1</sub>v<sub>m</sub>.

> ① v<sub>0</sub> is called the initial vertex, and v<sub>m</sub> is called the final vertex.

> ② The number of edges in the walk is called the length.

> ③ A walk where all nodes are distinct is called a path.

> ④ A walk where v<sub>0</sub> = v<sub>m</sub> is called a cycle.

> ⑤ Period **:** The period of a node i is the greatest common divisor of all paths from node i to itself.

>> ○ Example **:** If two nodes A and B are connected by two edges such that A = B, the period of each node is 2.

> ⑥ Aperiodic **:** When the period of all nodes is 1.

>> ○ Example **:** A walk where each node has a path leading back to itself is aperiodic.

⑺ A graph with undirected edges is called an undirected graph, while a graph with directed edges is called a directed graph.

⑻ Adjacency matrix **:** When the number of nodes is n, an n × n adjacency matrix is defined as follows.

<br>

⑼ Degree distribution **:** The ratio of nodes with degree k among all nodes, i.e., P(k) = N<sub>k</sub> / |V(G)|.

⑽ Distance **:** The length of the shortest path between two nodes. If no such path exists, the distance is defined as ∞.

⑾ Clustering coefficient **:** If the degree of a specific node is k<sub>i</sub> and the number of edges between the surrounding nodes connected to that node is e<sub>i</sub>, then:

<br>

> ① For example, if A is connected to B, C, and D, and there are additional edges B-C and C-D, then for A, e<sub>i</sub> = 2, k<sub>i</sub> = 3, C<sub>i</sub> = 2 / 3.

> ② k<sub>i</sub> (k<sub>i</sub> - 1) / 2 **:** The maximum number of edges that could be formed between the surrounding nodes.

> ③ C<sub>i</sub> has a value between 0 and 1, with a value close to 1 indicating that the surrounding nodes are fully connected.

## **2. Applications**

⑴ Pigeonhole principle

⑵ [The number of unique graphs depending on the number of nodes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2412) **:** Nearly perfectly follows an exponential function.

⑶ [Dijkstra and Floyd algorithms](https://jb243.github.io/pages/61)

⑷ [Algorithm for counting the number of subgraphs](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1892#:countingisland)

⑸ [The power of belief](https://jb243.github.io/pages/869)

⑹ Social network theory or six degrees of separation

> ① The theory that any two people on Earth are connected by no more than six intermediaries.

> ② Proof **:** If one person knows an average of 100 people, then after six steps, 100<sup>6</sup> = 1 billion, reaching a similar conclusion.

⑺ Perron-Frobenius theorem

> ① **Theorem 1.** If the Markov chain with transition matrix P is strongly connected, then there is exactly one steady-state distribution **q**.

>> ○ The steady-state distribution satisfies P**q** = **q**.

> ② **Theorem 2.** If it is also aperiodic, then:

>> ○ P<sub>ij</sub> **:** The probability of transitioning from node j to node i. ∑<sub>i</sub> P<sub>ij</sub> = 1.

>> ○ **2-1.** the matrix P<sup>k</sup> converges to a matrix with columns all equal to **q** as k → ∞; i.e., P<sub>ij</sub>(k) converges to **q**<sub>i</sub> (for any i and j) as k → ∞

>> ○ **2-2.** for any initial state **x**<sub>0</sub> is, the Markov Chain {**x**<sub>k</sub>} converges to **q** as k → ∞

⑻ Google's PageRank Algorithm

> ① **Step 1.** Represent web pages as a graph and express it as a Markov process transition matrix P.

> ② **Step 2.** For sink nodes, forcibly assign the transition probability to other pages as 1/n: P → P'.

> ③ **Step 3.** P'' = (1 - α) P' + α **1**.

> ④ **Step 4.** Search for the steady-state vector **x** such that P''**x** = **x**. The state-transition probability at this point can be considered as the importance of the recommended page.

⑼ Four color theorem

> ① Any map can be colored with at most four colors, ensuring that no two adjacent regions share the same color.

> ② The theorem was proven by verifying that the four-color theorem holds in all cases using a computer.

⑽ Eulerian path problem or Königsberg bridge problem

> ① An Eulerian path, which passes through each node exactly once, exists in a graph if and only if there are 0 or 2 nodes with odd degrees.

> ② If there are 2 nodes with odd degrees, one of these nodes is the starting point and the other is the endpoint.

> ③ There is no path that crosses all seven bridges of Königsberg exactly once.

⑾ Ramsey theory

> ① In any sufficiently large graph, a certain structure (e.g., a complete graph of acquaintances or a subgraph of strangers) must exist.

> ② R(s, t) **:** The minimum number of nodes such that a subgraph of s strangers or a subgraph of t acquaintances is guaranteed to exist.

> ③ **Theorem 1.** R(3, 3) = 6 **:** Among any 6 people, there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers. This can be proven by counting possibilities.

> ④ **Theorem 2.** R(3, 3, 3) = 17.

> ⑤ **Theorem 3.** R(3, 3, 4) = 30.

> ⑥ **Theorem 4.** Recurrence relation of R(s, t) **:** R(s, t) ≤ R(s-1, t) + R(s, t-1).

> ⑦ **Theorem 5.** Existence of an upper bound for R(s, t) **:** Proven through the recurrence relation of R(s, t) and mathematical induction ([ref](https://math.mit.edu/~fox/MAT307-lecture05.pdf)).

⑿ Schur's theorem

> ① For any k ≥ 2, there exists an n > 3 such that under k-coloring, there always exists a (x, y, z) satisfying x + y = z, colored the same way in {1, 2, ..., n}. Proven through Ramsey theory.

> ② This is connected to Fermat's Last Theorem, revealing the existence of (x, y, z) where x<sup>m</sup> + y<sup>m</sup> = z<sup>m</sup> (mod p).
