## **1\. Earth's Rotation**

 ⑴ Diurnal Motion

> ① Diurnal motion of stars **:** Apparent motion of stars due to the Earth's rotation. Period is 24 hours.

>> ○ **Direction of Earth's rotation** **:** West → East. Counterclockwise when viewed from the celestial North Pole.

>> ○ **Direction of diurnal motion** **:** East → West. Clockwise when viewed from the celestial North Pole ( **∵** Considering Earth's rotation in reverse)

>> ○ Diurnal circle **:** Path of stars' apparent motion. Parallel to the celestial equator.

>> ○ The apparent motion of stars can be analyzed with the **angular velocity vector in the direction of the celestial South Pole**.

>> ○ Reason why the Sun and stars rise in the east and set in the west.

>> ○ Stars in the Southern Hemisphere rise in the west and set in the east.

> ② Polar Stars, Rising and Setting Stars, Non-Rising Stars

>> ○ For stellar declination δ and observer's latitude Φ,

>> ○ Polar stars **:** Stars that never set below the horizon. (90° - Φ) ≤ δ ≤ 90°

>> ○ Rising stars **:** Stars that rise and set above the horizon. -(90° \- Φ) ≤ δ < (90° - Φ)

>> ○ Non-rising stars **:** Stars that never rise above the horizon. -90° ≤ δ < -(90° - Φ)

>> ○ Phenomenon of midnight sun and polar night occurs when the Sun becomes a polar star and non-rising star respectively.

>> ○ These conditions are not derived from formulas but are understood intuitively.

 ⑵ Evidence of Earth's Rotation

> ① Foucault Pendulum Rotation

>> ○ North Pole

>>> ○ Pendulum oscillation plane rotates clockwise **:** Due to Earth's counterclockwise rotation and the observer's motion.

>>> ○ Rotation period **:** Time for A and B to coincide, 24 hours.

**Figure 1.** Rotation of Foucault Pendulum at the North Pole

>> ○ South Pole **:** Counterclockwise, 24-hour period.

>> ○ Equator **:** No rotation of oscillation plane.

>> ○ Arbitrary Latitude **:** Conclusion combining polar region and equator observations.

**Figure 2.** Decomposition of Angular Velocity Vector at Arbitrary Latitude

>>> ○ Only the component of angular velocity vector perpendicular to the ground affects the rotation of the oscillation plane. Related to sinθ (θ **:** latitude).

>>> ○ Rotation direction of the oscillation plane **:** Opposite to Earth's rotation, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.

>>> ○ Period of oscillation plane rotation

> ② Coriolis Force

**Figure 3.** Coriolis Force 

>> ○ Fictitious force that deflects the motion of an object.

>> ○ Direction **:** Right-angle deflection to the direction of motion in the Northern Hemisphere, left-angle in the Southern Hemisphere.

>> ○ Magnitude **:** Maximum at the poles, 0 at the equator.

>> ○ Formula **:** For mass m, object's velocity v, Earth's angular velocity ω, and latitude Φ, the following holds

> ③ Satellite Westward Drift Phenomenon **:** The observed westward drift of a satellite in a fixed orbit as seen from the Earth's observer, caused by Earth's rotation.

**Figure 4.** Satellite Westward Drift Phenomenon 

> ④ Eastern Deflection of Free Fall Phenomenon **:** The phenomenon where a freely falling object deviates to the east as it falls.

>> ○ Assumption **:** Earth's radius R, distance between object A and surface h, latitude θ, angular acceleration Ω.

>> ○ Surface observer's linear velocity **:** RΩ cosθ

>> ○ Linear velocity of object A **:** (R+h)Ω cosθ

>> ○ Object A's linear velocity is greater than the surface observer's, causing object A to move further eastward relative to the surface observer.

 ⑶ Phenomena Resulting from Earth's Rotation

> ① Day and night occur.

> ② Celestial diurnal motion happens, i.e., celestial objects move from west to east by 15 degrees per hour.

> ③ The precession phenomenon occurs.

## **2\. Earth's Revolution**

 ⑴ Evidence of Earth's Revolution

> ① Aberration

>> ○ Phenomenon where starlight is observed to be inclined due to Earth's revolution.

>> ○ Aberration decreases as the revolution speed increases.

> ② Solar Annual Motion

> ③ Annual Parallax **:** Phenomenon where the position of stars appears to change periodically with a one-year cycle, represented by the angle formed by the Earth-Star-Sun system.

>> ○ Closest star's annual parallax is 0.76".

>> ○ Parallax decreases for more distant stars.

>> ○ Parallax 1" = Distance 1 parsec, r (pc) = 1 / P"

>> ○ Discovered by German astronomer Bessel in 1838.

> ④ Doppler Effect of Starlight **:** Redshift, blueshift.

 ⑵ Solar Annual Motion

> ① Solar Annual Motion **:** The Sun's daily motion of about 1 degree from west to east among the constellations.

**Figure 5.** Solar Annual Motion 

**Figure 6.** Constellations around the Ecliptic 

>> ○ Distant constellations show less effect due to the revolution.

>> ○ As the Earth revolves from west to east, the Sun also moves from west to east.

>> ○ If we fix the Sun, constellations appear to move from east to west by about 1 degree per day.

>> ○ Example **:** At noon on June, the constellation where the Sun is located is Taurus.

>> ○ Example **:** At noon on June, the constellation rising in the eastern sky is Leo.

>> ○ Example **:** The right ascension of Aquarius in March is approximately 0h, and the right ascension of Taurus in June is approximately 6h.

> ② Ecliptic **:** The path of the Sun's annual motion.

**Figure 7.** Ecliptic Plane in the Celestial Sphere 

> ○ **Horoscope of the Ecliptic (Horoscope)**: 12 constellations located on the ecliptic

> ○ The plane of the ecliptic and the equatorial plane of the celestial sphere form an inclination of 23.5°

> ○ The **angular velocity vector due to the annual motion** and the **angular velocity vector due to the solar apparent motion** form an angle of 180° - 23.5°

> ○ Equinox point at 06:00, Solstice point at 12:00, Autumnal equinox point at 18:00, Winter solstice point at 24:00, with the rest proportionally calculated

> ○ The above descriptions may contain errors. Subject to future revisions

> ③ Points of Division and Position

**Figure 8.** Points of Division and Position 

> ○ **Equinox**: Intersection of the ecliptic and the celestial equator (e.g., Vernal Equinox, Autumnal Equinox)

> ○ **Solstice**: The point where the Sun is farthest from the celestial equator (e.g., Summer Solstice, Winter Solstice)

> ○ **Vernal Equinox**: Declination = 0°, Right Ascension = 0h

> ○ **Summer Solstice**: Declination = 23.5°, Right Ascension = 6h

> ○ **Autumnal Equinox**: Declination = 0°, Right Ascension = 12h

> ○ **Winter Solstice**: Declination = -23.5°, Right Ascension = 18h

> ④ Changes in Solar Altitude

> ○ Solar noon altitude (Northern Hemisphere)

>> ○ Formula: h = 90° - Φ + δ (Φ: Latitude, δ: Solar Declination)

**Figure 9.** Formula for Solar Noon Altitude 

>> ○ The solar noon altitude forms a 90° angle with the horizon. Highest on the day of the Winter Solstice

> ○ Solar noon altitude (Southern Hemisphere)

>> ○ Formula: h* = 90° - Φ* + δ*

>> ○ h*: Solar noon altitude in the Southern Hemisphere reference

>> ○ Φ*: Latitude in the Southern Hemisphere reference

>> ○ δ*: Solar declination in the Southern Hemisphere reference

> ○ Solar energy received per unit area

>> ○ Solar energy received on the surface per unit area when the Sun's altitude is h

>> ○ Proportional to the product of solar energy at solar noon (E0) and sin h

>> ○ Maximum solar energy when the Sun's altitude is 90° (noon)

> ○ Changes in daylight hours by season

>> ○ Vernal Equinox to Autumnal Equinox: Daytime > Nighttime

>> ○ Vernal Equinox day and Autumnal Equinox day: Daytime = Nighttime

>> ○ Autumnal Equinox to Vernal Equinox: Daytime < Nighttime

> ⑤ Changes in Seasons

> ○ Cause: Changes in solar altitude and daylight hours

> ○ Summer: Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun. Sunlight is nearly vertical at around 20°N.

> ○ Winter: Southern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun. Sunlight is nearly vertical at around 20°S.

> ○ Equatorial regions receive the most concentrated sunlight, leading to higher temperatures.

> ○ In the Northern Hemisphere, proximity to the Sun in winter doesn't dictate the season

> ⑶ Motion of Stars

> ① Stars near the ecliptic plane appear as shapes closer to a straight line

> ② Stars near the ecliptic poles appear as shapes closer to a circle

> ③ If a star is not in the same position after one year, it has proper motion

## **3. Earth's Motion**

> ⑴ Precession

> ① Generally refers to the precession of the equinoxes

>> ○ Precession of the Equinoxes: Precession caused by the Sun and the Moon

>> ○ Planetary Precession: Precession caused by other planets

> ② Earth's Precession: Earth's axial rotation around the ecliptic pole

>> ○ Inclined at an angle of 23.5°

>> ○ Rotates 50 arc seconds per year from east to west: Vernal Equinox moves along the ecliptic by about 50 arc seconds per year

>> ○ Approximately 26,000-year cycle

> ③ Cause: Gravitational effects of the Moon and the Sun near the equator of the Earth

> ④ Result: Tries to upright the Earth's tilted axis of 23.5°

> ⑵ Results of Precession

> ① North Polar Motion of the Celestial Sphere

>> ○ The north pole of the celestial sphere rotates counterclockwise around the ecliptic north pole every 26,000 years

>> ○ After about 12,000 years, the north pole of the celestial sphere will be near the North Celestial Pole

> ② Movement of the Vernal Equinox: Moves 50 arc seconds per year (East to West) → This affects the celestial coordinates

> ③ Difference between Sidereal Year and Tropical Year (Solar Year)

>> ○ Sidereal Year: Time for the Sun to return to the same position relative to the constellations = 365.2564 days

>> ○ Tropical Year (Solar Year): Time for the Sun to return to the same position relative to the vernal equinox = 365.2422 days

>> ○ Sidereal Year is longer than the Tropical Year due to the precession of the equinoxes

> ⑶ Nutation

> ⑷ Wobbling

## **4. Earth's Spacetime**

> ⑴ Time

> ① Sidereal Time and Solar Time

>> ○ Sidereal Day: The interval between successive transits of the vernal equinox (actual Earth's rotation period), referred to as sidereal day

>> ○ Sidereal Time: The hour angle of a celestial object at the time of its transit

>> ○ Solar Day: The interval between successive solar transits, not exactly constant, but its average value over a year, the mean solar day (24 hours), is used

>> ○ Solar Time = Solar Hour Angle + 12 hours

>> ○ Equation of Time: Solar Time - Mean Solar Time, due to the non-constant Earth's axial tilt and orbital speed

> ② Standard Time

>> ○ Local Time: Time set to 12 when the mean Sun transits the local meridian

>> ○ Standard Time: Time set to 12 when the Sun transits the standard meridian at 15° intervals

>> ○ Universal Time: Local Time at the Royal Greenwich Observatory

>> ○ International Date Line

>> > ○ Approximately 180° meridian of East/West longitude

>> > ○ Crossing from East to West (West to East) results in a day gained (or lost)

> ⑵ Location

> ① Determination of Longitude: Defined with the Prime Meridian as 0°, East as 180°, West as -180°

>> ○ Method using two stars transiting at the same time: If stars A and B transit local times L and G simultaneously

>> > ○ Longitude of L = (Right Ascension of star A - Right Ascension of star B) × 15° per hour = (Sidereal Time of L - Sidereal Time of G) × 15° per hour

>> > ○ L > 0: East Longitude, L < 0: West Longitude

>> ○ Method using the time difference of a star's transit: If a star transits L and G at times L and G respectively

>> > ○ Longitude of L = (Time of G - Time of L) × 15° per hour

>> > ○ L > 0: East Longitude, L < 0: West Longitude

> ② Determination of Latitude

>> ○ Altitude of the North Star = Latitude

>> ○ Solar Altitude: h = 90° - Φ + δ, where Φ is the celestial latitude

> ⑶ Strategy

> ① Lunar Calendar: Based on the lunar phase cycle (synodic month) of 29.5 days, with 1 year as 354 days

>> ○ Metonic Cycle: 19 years with 7 intercalary months to synchronize with seasons

>> ○ 24 Solar Terms: Dividing the year into 24 parts based on the Sun's ecliptic position

> ② Solar Calendar: Based on the Sun, accurate with seasons

>> ○ Julian Calendar: A year is 365.25 days, with a leap year every 4 years

>> ○ Gregorian Calendar

>> > ○ Introduced by Pope Gregory XIII to rectify the inaccuracies of the Julian Calendar

>> > ○ Leap years divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, except if divisible by 400

>> > ○ The Gregorian Calendar is accurate to 365.2422 days per year
