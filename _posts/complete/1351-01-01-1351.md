## **1. Equilibrium State**

⑴ Equilibrium State: A state where the rates of the forward reaction and the reverse reaction are equal, resulting in no further change in the concentration of chemical species.

> ① Homogeneous: When all reactants and products are in the same state.

> ② Heterogeneous: When more than one state coexist.

⑵ Equilibrium Constant: A constant that remains constant at equilibrium.

> ① Concentration Equilibrium Constant, Kc: Calculated using molar concentrations for solutions.

> ② Pressure Equilibrium Constant, Kp: Used for gas-phase reactions.

> ③ Thermodynamic Equilibrium Constant, K: Introduces the concept of activity.

>> ○ Activity of Gases

>>> aideal gas = P ÷ Pº, Pº = 1 atm

>>> ⇔ aideal gas = P (unitless)

>> ○ Activity of Solutions

>>> asolution = C ÷ Cº, Cº = 1 M

>>> ⇔ asolution = C (unitless)

>> ○ Activity of Solids and Liquids

>>> asolid = aliquid = 1

>> ○ Thermodynamic Equilibrium Constant

>> ○ Mean Activity Coefficient γ: Geometric mean of activity coefficients of each ion.

>>> ○ Example: Mean activity coefficient of CaCl2 = (γCa2+ × γCl-)1/3

⑶ **Derivation of Equilibrium Constant 1:** [Thermodynamic Interpretation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1344)

> The free energy of A, B, C, D is expressed as follows.

> Additionally, the change in free energy of the reaction is expressed as follows.

> Therefore, the following conclusion is obtained.

> For equilibrium constant K, the following equation holds.

> Since ΔGº is constant, K is also constant.

⑷ **Derivation of Equilibrium Constant 2:** [Kinetic Interpretation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1350)

> If the rate constant for the forward reaction is k1 and for the reverse reaction is k-1, then the rate equation is as follows.

> In equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, thus:

> **Supplement:** At equilibrium, it is possible to treat it as a single-step reaction and derive rate equations.

⑸ Reaction Quotient Q: A constant indicating the extent of reaction at a given moment.

> ① Relationship between ΔGr (free energy change at a certain time) and standard free energy change ΔGrº

>> ○ Standard Gibbs Free Energy Change ΔGrº: Change in free energy when 1 mole of product is formed under standard conditions.

>> ○ ΔGrº ＜ 0: Spontaneous forward reaction at standard conditions, K＞1

>> ○ ΔGrº ＞ 0: Spontaneous reverse reaction at standard conditions, K＜1

>> ○ ΔGrº = 0: Equilibrium at standard conditions, K = 1

> ② Relationship between Reaction Quotient Q and Equilibrium Constant K

>> ○ Q > K: Spontaneous reverse reaction

>> ○ Q < K: Spontaneous forward reaction

>> ○ Q = K: Equilibrium state

⑹ Manipulation of Reaction Equations

> ① **Rule 1:** If the equilibrium constant K0 is multiplied by a coefficient k, the new equilibrium constant is K = K0k.

> ② **Rule 2:** If equilibrium constants K1 and K2 correspond to two reactions, then their addition yields K = K1 × K2.

> ③ **Rule 3:** If the equilibrium constant K1 corresponds to a reaction from which another reaction with equilibrium constant K2 is subtracted, then their subtraction yields K = K1 ÷ K2.

⑺ Predicting the Extent of Reaction Based on Equilibrium Constant K

> ① K ＞ 103: Product-dominant reaction

> ② K = 10-3 ~ 103: No dominant direction

> ③ K ＜ 10-3: Reactant-dominant reaction

## **2. Le Chatelier's Principle**

⑴ Definition: Principle stating that a system at equilibrium will shift its position to minimize any change that is imposed upon it.

⑵ Shift due to Concentration Changes

> ① Adding a substance causes a shift in the direction that reduces the added substance.

> ② Adding an irrelevant substance does not cause a shift.

⑶ Shift due to Volume Changes

> ① Increasing the volume of a gas shifts the equilibrium in the direction of increased gas molecules.

>> ○ (Note) Natural tendency is to resist change, but in this case, amplification of change is observed.

> ② Increasing the pressure of a gas shifts the equilibrium in the direction of decreased gas molecules.

> ③ Increasing the volume of a solution shifts the equilibrium in the direction of increased particles.

> ④ Effect of Inert Gas Addition

>> ○ Constant volume condition: No shift in equilibrium

>> ○ Constant pressure condition: Inert gas increases volume, causing a shift in the direction of increased gas molecules.

⑷ Shift due to Temperature Changes

> ① Higher temperature favors endothermic reactions.

> ② At higher temperature, equilibrium constant of exothermic reactions decreases, while that of endothermic reactions increases.

> ③ (Note) With increased temperature, the number of molecules surpassing activation energy increases, causing an increase in both forward and reverse reactions.

## **3. Challenging Problem Type: Gas + Chemical Equilibrium**

⑴ Reasons for Difficulty

> ① Equilibrium constant is calculated using pressure, but the chemical reaction itself should be considered in terms of moles, leading to increased calculations.

> ② **Tip:** Solve problems using pressure only.

⑵ Initial State

> ① Calculate based on ⑶ to ⑸.

> ② When temperature changes: Since equilibrium constant changes, consider the given state as the initial state.

⑶ Fixed Volume Apparatus

> ① Define initial pressures of A, B, C as PA0, PB0, PC0.

> ② Since pressure ratio is the same as mole ratio, the final pressures can be represented as follows.

> ③ α can be determined based on the given equilibrium constant.

⑷ Total Pressure as Constant

> ① Define initial pressures of A, B, C as PA0, PB0, PC0.

> ② First, carry out the chemical reaction and adjust the ideal gas equation, yielding the same final state.

> ③ In considering the mole ratio of the chemical reaction, the later pressures of A, B, C can be represented as follows.

> ④ Considering the ideal gas equation, the final pressures of A, B, C can be represented as follows.

> ⑤ α can be determined based on the given equilibrium constant.

⑸ Constant Final Volume

> ① Mostly, questions ask whether Pf = β.

> ② First estimate the final pressure using the ideal gas equation.

>> ○ Calculate nf

>> ○ Calculate α

>> ○ Calculate individual pressures

> ③ Confirm if the assumption Pf = β is valid by substituting into the given equilibrium constant.
