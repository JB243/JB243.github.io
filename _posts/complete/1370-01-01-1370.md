## 1\. Aromaticity

⑴ Aromaticity: Having much lower energy than expected, with significantly altered reactivity which is related to aromatic substituent effect.

⑵ **Hückel's rule**: Aromaticity is achieved if four conditions are met

> ① Ring structure

>> ○ Reason: Ring structures facilitate overlap of p orbitals

> ② Planar structure

>> ○ cyclooctatetraene is not planar, hence not aromatic

>> ○ However, treating cyclooctatetraene with 2eq K leads to a planar structure with 10 π electrons

> ③ All atoms forming the planar ring must satisfy conjugation

> ④ The number of π electrons in p orbitals must be 4n + 2, where n = 0, 1, 2, ···

>> ○ Tied to the conditions for forming planar rings (e.g., cyclooctatetraene is not planar, so not aromatic)

>> ○ 2π systems have ring strain, so 6π systems are more common

⑶ Frost's Circle (polygon rule)

> ① Draw an inscribed circle for a given ring structure

> ② The MO located below relative to the center of the circle is the bonding MO, the MO located above is the antibonding MO, and the one at the center height is the nonbonding MO.

> ③ Aromaticity is satisfied if there are no electrons in the antibonding MO and no unpaired electrons.

**Figure 1.** Benzene, Pyridine, Pyrrole

<br>

> ① Benzene: Satisfies Hückel's rule

> ② Pyridine: Satisfies Hückel's rule. Nitrogen's lone electron pairs do not participate in resonance, acting as a weak base

> ③ Pyrrole: Satisfies Hückel's rule. Nitrogen's lone electron pair participates in resonance, lacking basicity

⑸ Anti-aromaticity, Non-aromaticity

> ① Anti-aromaticity: Only the π electron count condition changes from 4n+2 to 4n in Hückel's rule, thus not satisfying Hückel's rule and not having aromaticity.

> ② Cyclooctatetraene has 4n π electrons (n=2), but not all carbons lie in the same plane, making it non-aromatic, not anti-aromatic.

> ③ Possessing aromaticity results in substitution reactions only, while possessing antiaromaticity or non-aromaticity leads to addition reactions only, similar to alkenes

⑹ [Python code to determine aromaticity](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2396)

<br>

```python
from rdkit import Chem

def is_aromatic(smiles):
    molecule = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
    if molecule is None:
        return False
    return any(atom.GetIsAromatic() for atom in molecule.GetAtoms())

# Example usage
cyclohexane = "C1CCCCC1"  # cyclohexane
benzene = "c1ccccc1"  # benzene
imidazole = "C1=CN=CN1" # 1H-imidazole

print(f"The {cyclohexane} is {'aromatic' if is_aromatic(cyclohexane) else 'not aromatic'}")
print(f"The {benzene} is {'aromatic' if is_aromatic(benzene) else 'not aromatic'}")
print(f"The {imidazole} is {'aromatic' if is_aromatic(imidazole) else 'not aromatic'}")
```

## **2. [Benzene Derivatives Nomenclature](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357)**

⑴ Substituent Naming

⑵ Numbering

> ① If there is only one substituent, no number is assigned.

> ② Arrange the numbers so that the carbon atom with the higher priority functional group has the lower number.

>> ○ The carbon atom with the highest priority functional group is numbered as 1.

> ③ If multiple numberings are possible, assign the numbers in a way that the carbon atoms with the same priority functional groups have the fewest numbers.

> ④ Even so, if multiple cases are possible, substituents should be numbered in alphabetical order, giving the lower numbers to the substituents that come first alphabetically.

**Figure 2.** 1-Bromo-2-chloro-4-ethyl-5-nitrobenzene

<br>

> ⑤ For 1,2-substitution, use ortho(o-); for 1,3-substitution, use meta(m-); for 1,4-substitution, use para(p-).

⑶ Suffix Naming: Use common names approved by IUPAC

> ① If the main functional group is a carboxylic acid (-COOH): 《··· + benzoic acid》

> ② If the main functional group is an aldehyde (-CHO): 《··· + benzaldehyde》

> ③ If the main functional group is -COMe: 《··· + acetophenone》

> ④ If the main functional group is a hydroxyl group (-OH): 《··· + phenol》

> ⑤ If the main functional group is an amino group (-NH<sub>2</sub>): 《··· + aniline》

> ⑥ If the main functional group is an ether (-OMe): 《··· + anisol》

> ⑦ If the main functional group is a methyl group (-CH<sub>3</sub>): 《··· + toluene》

> ⑧ Others: chlorobenzene, styrene, t-butylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, cumene, nitrobenzene, benzonitrile, mesitylene, o-cresol, m-cresol

⑷ Full Name Naming

> ① Rearrange groups with equal priority in alphabetical order

> ② Name as 《(substituent position-substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + main chain + suffix》

⑸ When Benzene Rings are Treated as Substituents

> ① If the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl substituent is less than that in benzene, the alkyl group is treated as a substituent.

> ② If the alkyl substituent has equal or more carbons than benzene, treat benzene as the substituent and express it as phenyl(= Ph, Φ)

>> ○ Example: 2-phenylhexane (= _n_ -hexylbenzene)

> ③ If higher-priority functional groups like alkenes are present, benzene is treated as the substituent

⑴ Kekulé Structure: Single and double bonds are interchangeable, with all bond lengths being the same

> ① C-C single bond length: 154 pm

> ② C=C double bond length: 134 pm

> ③ Benzene's carbon-carbon bond length: 139 pm, all carbon-carbon bond lengths are the same

⑵ Lower-than-expected Hydrogenation Enthalpy

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/0a3f050e-9562-4859-a5b4-56204950957d)

**Figure 15.** Benzene's Lower-than-Expected Hydrogenation Enthalpy

<br>

> ① Cyclohexene has 28.6 kcal/mol (= 118 kJ/mol) more energy than cyclohexane.

> ② 1,3-cyclohexadiene has 230 kJ/mol more energy than cyclohexane.

> ③ The mismatch between 230 kJ/mol and 236 kJ/mol (= 118 × 2) arises from resonance stabilization.

> ④ Benzene has 49.8 kcal/mol (= 206 kJ/mol) more energy than cyclohexane.

> ⑤ 36 kcal/mol (= 152 kJ/mol) in the figure above represents benzene's resonance stabilization energy

⑶ Low Reactivity of Benzene: Unlike alkenes or alkynes, benzene's reactions are difficult to initiate

> ① **Exception 1.** Reaction under high temperature and pressure to form cyclohexane

>> ○ H<sub>2</sub> / Ni

>> ○ H<sub>2</sub>, Pt, ethanol, 130 atm, 25 ℃

>> ○ H<sub>2</sub>, Rh / C, ethanol, 1 atm, 25 ℃

> ② **Exception 2.** <b>Exception 2:</b> Catalytic Deuteration Reaction: Under high temperature and pressure, benzene reacts with D<sub>2</sub>, Rh / C conditions, leading to <i>syn</i> addition of deuterium atoms to benzenes.
  
⑷ Benzene's Stability: When substituents donate electrons, benzene becomes unstable; when withdrawing, it becomes more stable

<br>

## **4. Reaction 1. Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution**

⑴ Overview: Halogenation, Sulfonation, Nitration, Acylation, Alkylation, Peroxide

> ① Abbreviated as EAS.

> ② Benzene is a weak nucleophile

> ③ Electrophilic reactions proceed using highly reactive electrophiles E<sup>+</sup>

>> ○ Formation of arenium ion E<sup>+</sup> is the rate-determining step

> ④ E<sup>+</sup> is generated within the reaction system using a catalyst

> ⑤ **Tendency 1.** Benzene rings perform better in EAS as electron density increases

>> ○ In isoquinoline, the carbons in the ring containing nitrogen have a lower electron density, so reactions occur first in the aromatic ring without nitrogen.

> ⑥ **Tendency 2.** benzene ＜ thiophene ＜ furan ＜ pyrrole

>> ○ Aromaticity: benzene ＞ thiophene ＞ pyrrole ＞ furan

⑵ **Reaction 1.** Halogenation

> ① **1-1.** Benzene Halogenation: **(Formula)** X<sub>2</sub> + FeX<sub>3</sub> → FeX<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> + X<sup>+</sup>

**Figure 17.** Benzene Halogenation Mechanism

<br>

>> ○ Fluorination: Reaction is very fast. Using F-TEDA-BF<sub>4</sub> as a reagent can improve the reaction

>> ○ Iodination: Reaction is slow. Treating with nitric acid can enhance aromatic compounds' electrophilicity.

> ② **1-2.** Furan Halogenation: Reaction under dioxane / 0 ℃

>> ○ The reason _ortho_ orientation is dominant over _para_ orientation is because _ortho_ orientation has a greater number of resonance contributors.

**Figure 20.** Sulfonation of furan

<br>

>> ○ The reason _ortho_ orientation is dominant over _para_ orientation is because _ortho_ orientation has a greater number of resonance contributors.

> ③ Features

>> ○ The only Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) reaction that is reversible: This allows it to be used as a protective reaction for aromatic compounds from EAS.

>> ○ Sulfonation reactions proceed in concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

>> ○ Desulfonation reactions occur in dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

>> ○ Alkali fusion: In benzene with a sulfonyl group, under NaOH and heat conditions, the SO<sub>3</sub>H group is replaced by SO<sub>3</sub>, and an OH group is attached instead.

⑷ **Reaction 3.** Nitration

> ① **3-1.** Benzene Nitration: **(Formula)** [HONO<sub>2</sub>](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1412) + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → NO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O

>> ○ Reaction proceeds well in high-concentration H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub>

>> ○ Reaction can also be achieved using NO2BF4 reagent other than HNO<sub>3</sub> / H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>

>> ○ **(Formula 1)** H<sub>2</sub> / Pd converts -NO<sub>2</sub> group to -NH<sub>2</sub> group

>> ○ **(Formula 2)** Sn / HCl converts -NO<sub>2</sub> group to -NH<sub>2</sub> group

>> ○ Organic Chemistry Experiment

>>> ○ Initially, introduce concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid, then cool to room temperature and open the reflux apparatus

>>> ○ Adjust the temperature to suppress dinitration

<br>

> ⑤ **4-4.** Gattermann-Koch Reaction

>> ○ It is not feasible to introduce a formyl group (-CHO) into benzene through ordinary Friedel-Crafts acylation

>> ○ Under pressure with HCl and Lewis acid, benzene can react with CO, resulting in the formyl group substitution.

> ⑥ **4-5.** Blanc Chloromethylation

>> ○ Reagents: HCl, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ Product: 1-(chloromethyl)benzene

> ⑦ **4-6.** Fries rearrangement reaction

>> ○ phenol + RCOCl: O-acylation

>> ○ phenol + RCOCl + AlCl<sub>3</sub>: C-acylation (Friedel-Crafts acylation)

>> ○ The Fries rearrangement reaction converts O-acylated products into C-acylated products through rearrangement reactions.

> ⑧ Limitations

>> ○ **Problem 1:** Vinyl halides and aryl halides cannot act as substrates: Carbocations are highly unstable, leading to low reactivity.

>> ○ **Problem 2:** Aromatic rings substituted with a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG) do not undergo acylation reactions.

>> ○ **Problem 3:** Exceptionally, despite the substitution of an EDG, aniline does not undergo the reaction.

>>> ○ **Reason:** The -NH<sub>2</sub> group in aniline is transformed into -N<sup>+</sup>H<sub>2</sub>AlCl<sub>3</sub> through reaction with AlCl<sub>3</sub> and acid, becoming a strong EWG.

**Figure 27.** Mechanism of benzene alkylation

<br>

>> ○ Rearrangement reaction can proceed like R<sup>+</sup> → R*<sup>+</sup>.

>> ○ For secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides, SbF<sub5</sub> (antimony pentafluoride, super acid) is used instead of AlCl<sub>3</sub>.

> ③ Limitations

>> ○ **Problem 1:** **Rearrangement reaction:** Friedel-Crafts acylation does not involve rearrangement reactions.

>> ○ **Problem 2:** Vinyl halides and aryl halides cannot act as substrates: Carbocations are highly unstable, leading to low reactivity.

>> ○ **Problem 3:** Aromatic rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) do not undergo alkylation and acylation.

>> ○ **Problem 4:** Aniline, despite being an electron-donating group (EDG), does not undergo the reaction.

>>> ○ **Reason:** The -NH<sub>2</sub> group in aniline is transformed into -N<sup>+</sup>H<sub>2</sub>AlCl<sub>3</sub> through reaction with AlCl<sub>3</sub> and acid, becoming a strong EWG.

>> ○ **Problem 5:** Multiple alkylation reactions: This is because the EAS reactivity of benzene increases as more alkyl groups are added.

> ④ Heck coupling (Heck reaction)

>> ○ **(Reaction)** When a haloalkene or haloarene reacts with vinyl-H (i.e., the hydrogen attached to the alkene) under palladium catalyst and base, the vinyl-H undergoes substitution with an R-group, with the release of HX. For instance, if the reactant were a haloarene, then the phenyl group would be substituted.

>> ○ Solvents: Polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, CH<sub>3</sub>CN, DMSO to dissolve Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub>.

>> ○ Ligands: Ph<sub>3</sub>P is commonly used as a ligand for coordinating with Pd(0)

>> ○ Mechanism: Formation of square planar Pd(Ⅱ) intermediate

>> ○ High regioselectivity: Occurs predominantly at the less substituted side of the vinyl-H (due to steric effect)

>> ○ High stereoselectivity: Only _trans_ products are obtained

>> ○ Reactivity of halides: I > Br > Cl

>> ○ Faster reaction and higher yield with less substitution on the double bond (due to steric effect)

>> ○ **Reason 1:** Phenyl groups create steric hindrance.

>> ○ **Reason 2:** Halogen groups exhibit double-bond-like character due to resonance.

>> ○ **Reason 3:** sp<sup>2</sup> carbons have strong bonding strength.

> ② Not S<sub>N</sub>1-like: Phenyl cations are unstable.

 ⑵ **Reaction 1:** Elimination Reaction after Addition

> ① **1-1.** General addition-elimination reaction

<br>

<br>

>> ○ Addition of a nucleophile to the halogen position followed by the release of the halogen group.

>> ○ The intermediate is called meisenheimer.

>> ○ Formation of meisenheimer is the rate-determining step

>> ○ Reaction occurs more readily when EWGs are oriented in ortho or para positions, compared to EAS.

>> ○ Comparison of reaction rates for halogen groups: Larger electronegativity stabilizes the intermediate due to electron-withdrawing effect.

>>> ○ F ≫ Cl > Br ≫ I

⑶ **Reaction 2:** Addition Reaction after Elimination: Formation of Benzyne

> ① **2-1.** General elimination-addition reaction

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/c69e2d0e-39c6-4833-9026-c8167b3fedf3)

**Figure. 36.** Elimination-addition reaction 

<br>

>> ○ Characteristics of benzyne

>>> ○ Carbons participating in triple bonds have intermediate characteristics of sp and sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization.

>>> ○ If a carbon with sp hybridization is present, it forms a linear structure due to [VSEPR](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1330#1-vsepr-valence-shell-electron-pair-repulsion-model), resulting in ring strain and antiaromaticity.

>>> ○ Therefore, benzyne's triple bond consists of 1 π bond, 1 σ bond, and 1 additional σ bond.

>>> ○ Thus, when benzene is formed from an alkene, the newly formed π bond results from the overlap of sp<sup>2</sup>-sp<sup>2</sup> orbitals.

<br>

**Figure 37.** Concept of benzyne bonding

<br>

>> ○ Addition of bases to halogenated benzene results in the formation of benzyne.

>> ○ Commonly used bases: KNH<sub>2</sub>, NaNH<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ Characteristics of addition reaction after elimination

>>> ○ Formation of benzyne intermediate is the rate-determining step.

>>> ○ Observation of kinetic isotope effect is possible due to difficulty in removing hydrogen.

>>> ○ The reaction rate increases as the halogen element becomes easier to leave as a leaving group.

>>>> ○ F ＜ Cl ＜ Br ＜ I

>> ○ For benzynes, the determination of nucleophilic and electrophilic carbons considers only the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the substituents.

>>> ○ Example: -OMe is an electron-donating group (EDG), but when assessing the stability of benzyne, there is no resonance effect, so it is considered an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) due solely to the inductive effect.

>>> ○ Substituents emerge in the meta orientation to the EWG.

>> ○ Addition reaction after elimination in the case of benzene with two substituents

>>> ○ When the two substituents are _ortho_ or _meta_: _meta_ substitution.

>>> ○ When the two substituents are para: para substitution in the case of electron-withdrawing effects, meta substitution in the case of electron-donating effects.

>> ○ -NH<sub>2</sub> group is a strong EDG, allowing reaction with anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R) without a catalyst.

>> ○ Results in the formation of acetanilide, which is an amide.

>> ○ **Benefit 1.** Protection of -NH<sub>2</sub> group

>> ○ **Benefit 2.** Decreased reactivity of aniline: Aniline is highly reactive, producing 3-substituted products in halogenation reactions.

**Figure 39.** Birch reduction mechanism

<br>

>> ○ Alkali metals react vigorously with water to become ions.

>> ○ A radical electron is released, which enters the benzene ring, followed by resonance.

>> ○ Another electron enters, and NH<sub>3</sub> **acts as an acid** in a unique way to recover the two radical electrons.

>> ○ Subsequently, ROH-catalyzed tautomerization may occur.

> ③ **(Reaction 1)** Adjust the position of double bonds so that two opposite points on the benzene ring become sp<sup>3</sup>.

> ④ **(Reaction 2)** The position becoming sp<sup>3</sup> should be located with an EWG and not an EDG.

>> ○ Resonance-stabilized alkenes cannot be reduced.

>> ○ Carboxylic acids and esters cannot be reduced.

## **7. Substituent Effects**

⑴ Substituent groups: The concept of substituent groups is not limited to aromatic compounds only

> ① Strong activating substituents: -NH<sub>2</sub>, -NHR, -NR<sub>2</sub>, -OH, -O-

>> ○ Groups with lone pairs of electrons

> ② Moderate activating substituents: -NHCOCH<sub>3</sub>, -NHCOR, -OCOCH<sub>3</sub>, -OCH<sub>3</sub>, -OR

>> ○ Groups with lone pairs of electrons, but also have significant electron-withdrawing effects

> ③ Weak activating substituents: -R, -Phe

>> ○ Groups that donate electrons

> ④ -H: Benzene

> ⑤ Weak deactivating substituents: -X

>> ○ Halogen groups

> ⑥ Moderate deactivating substituents: -C≡N, -SO<sub>3</sub>H, -CO<sub>2</sub>H, -CO<sub>2</sub>R, -CHO, -COR

>> ○ Acetyl group (-COR) is weaker EWG than nitrile group (-C≡N) or sulfone group (-SO3H)

> ⑦ Strong deactivating substituents: -CF<sub>3</sub>, -CCl<sub>3</sub>, -NO<sub>2</sub>, -N<sup>+</sup>R<sub>3</sub>

>> ○ Have positive charge or -CF<sub>3</sub> group

>> ○ -CF3 and -NR3 have weak electron-withdrawing abilities as EWG, but they are highly effective at reducing reactivity.

⑵ Activating substituents (EDG, electron-donating group): **ortho substitution** , **para substitution**

> ① Strong/Moderate activating substituents

>> ○ Electron-donating Resonance effect > Electron-withdrawing Inductive effect: Donate electrons to the reactant benzene, causing instability and increasing reactivity.

>> ○ In the case of intermediates, they stabilize carbocation by donating electrons

>> ○ React rapidly due to low activation energy

> ② Weak activating substituents: Donate electrons to the reactant benzene, causing instability and increasing reactivity.

⑶ Deactivating substituents (EWG, electron-withdrawing group)

> ① Halogen groups: **ortho substitution, para substitution**

>> ○ Electron-withdrawing Inductive effect > Electron-donating Resonance effect

>>> ○ F: Strong electronegativity leads to stronger electron-withdrawing inductive effect than electron-donating resonance effect → Deactivation

>>> ○ Cl, Br, I: Poor resonance effect of lone pairs of electrons due to poor overlap of p orbitals by the difference of periods of atoms. For example, Cl in 3<sup>rd</sup> period will interact with carbons in the 2<sup>nd</sup> period, resulting in 2p-3p orbital interactions and decreasing the resonance effect compared to 2p-2p interactions.

>>> ○ Fluorobenzene is more electrophilic than other halobenzenes: The importance of p-p orbital overlap!

>> ○ F > Cl > Br > I in terms of both EAS and SNAr reactivity.

>> ○ Halogen groups are considered as EDGs under certain conditions

>>> ○ When comparing reaction rates among various benzene derivatives, halogen groups are considered as EWGs, leading to slower reactions

>>> ○ When determining major product from halobenzene, _ortho_ or _para_ isomers are obtained as major products, like EDGs

>>> ○ **Reason**: Electron-donating resonance effect from lone pairs in halogen induces major production of _ortho_ or _para_ isomers

>>> ○ When halogen group is competing with R group, major product comes from _ortho_ or _para_ isomer of the halogen group, independent from the position of R group.

>>> ○ **Reason**: Under conditions where the halogen group is considered as an EDG, electron-donating effect is better than R group

> ② Strong/Moderate deactivating substituents: **meta substitution**

>> ○ There's an effect of withdrawing electrons from the reactant benzene, which stabilizes the reactant.

>> ○ For intermediates, they withdraw electrons from carbocation, making intermediates unstable

>> ○ Reaction is slower due to higher activation energy

⑷ Most reactive group determines major product

⑸ Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>Ar) reaction

> ① When leaving group (e.g., X<sup>-</sup>) and EWG are at _o_ or _p_ positions, a reaction occurs where nucleophile is added first, then leaving group is removed

⑹ Judgment of aromatic heterocyclic compounds

> ① [Dipole Moments of Aromatic Heterocyclic Compounds](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1330)

> ② Nitration of aniline

>> ○ For monosubstitution, meta and para substitution occur in a 1:1 ratio

>> ○ Reason: Nitrogen in aniline acts as an EWG when protonated

> ③ benzofuran is major product (exception)
