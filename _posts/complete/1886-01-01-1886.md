## **♣︎ A word from the author ♣︎**

I opened a blog called "Jeongbin's Study Room" to collect stories from many people. The enthusiasm for organic chemistry is still strong today, but a few years ago, it was significant, as organic chemistry was essential for various entrance exams. Since studying organic chemistry in elementary, middle, and high school was rare, I anticipated a significant academic demand for organic chemistry. Therefore, since 2018, I have been sharing articles on organic chemistry on "Jeongbin's Study Room" and communicating, correcting, and discussing with people. I have had many discussions online with medical professionals, pharmacists, lawyers, current teachers, and professors, among others. Now, as we welcome the new year 2022, I declare that the compilation of organic chemistry knowledge through collective intelligence is complete and I am publishing this book. I hope that this book can lower the barrier of organic chemistry as a field of study.

Halogenated alkyls and alkenes are highly reactive and are learned in the earlier part, but it is essential to remember that the truly important reactions are those with low reactivity but suitable for administration to the human body, such as aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, amines, etc. PEET is based on a second-year completion standard, so it includes the alcohol section. However, MEET/DEET requires a university graduate level, so it shows a relatively concentrated distribution of questions related to aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, etc.

In February 2023, I modified the cover of the organic chemistry book to feature colorful illustrations of bees and beehives. There are two main reasons for this. First, I found it interesting that beehives evoke the most famous organic compound in organic chemistry, the benzene ring. Additionally, I wanted to raise awareness of environmental issues related to bee extinction.
