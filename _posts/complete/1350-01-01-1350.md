## **3\. Reaction Mechanism**

⑴ Reaction Mechanism **:** A single reaction is divided into multiple elementary reactions, with each reactant contributing in proportion to its coefficient.

⑵ Elementary Reaction (Unit Step Reaction)

> ① Molecularity **:** The number of molecules participating in the reaction.

>> ○ Unimolecular Reaction **:** Molecularity is 1

>> ○ Bimolecular Reaction **:** Molecularity is 2

>> ○ Termolecular Reaction **:** Molecularity is 3

>> ○ Termolecular reactions are rare in nature due to the difficulty in arranging suitable reaction conditions.

>> ○ Combining unimolecular and bimolecular reactions to form a mechanism is more natural.

> ② Elementary reactions determine the order of the overall reaction.

>> ○ A → P **:** rate = k [A]

>> ○ A + B → P **:** rate = k [A][B]

>> ○ A + A → P **:** rate = k [A]2

>> ○ A + B + C → P **:** rate = k [A][B][C]

>> ○ A + A + B → P **:** rate = k [A]2[B]

>> ○ A + A + A → P **:** rate = k [A]3

⑶ **Method 1:** Rate-Determining Step (RDS) **:** Included in **Method 2** and **Method 3**

> ① Reaction Mechanism Example

> ② Rate-Determining Step **:** The slowest step in the reaction mechanism, has the greatest impact on the overall reaction rate.

> ③ Overall Reaction Rate Equation

⑷ **Method 2:** Quasi-Steady-State Approximation

> ① Mechanism Example

>> ○ If interpreted as **Method 1**, the overall reaction rate equation is as follows:

>> ○ Limitation **:** If the first step is not the rate-determining step, the overall reaction rate equation becomes an expression involving intermediates, making it less useful.

> ② Assumption **:** The concentration of intermediate N2O2 reaches a rapid equilibrium in the first step.

> ③ Overall Reaction Rate Equation

⑸ **Method 3:** Rapid Equilibrium (Pre-Equilibrium Approximation) **:** Preferred over **Method 2**

> ① Mechanism Example **:** Same as **Method 2**

> ② Assumption **:** Rapid equilibrium is assumed in the first step of the one-step reaction.

> ③ Overall Reaction Rate Equation

## **4.** **Michaelis-Menten Equation**

⑴ Michaelis-Menten Equation

> ① **Derivation 1:** Quasi-Steady-State

>> ○ kcat **:** Reaction rate constant for ES → E + P

>> ○ V **:** Rate of product formation

>> ○ Vm = kcat [ES] ≤ kcat E0 (where E0 is total enzyme concentration)

> ② **Derivation 2:** Rapid Equilibrium **:** Mainly adopted. Assumes that the first reaction reaches equilibrium rapidly.

> ③ Graphical Methods

>> ○ Michaelis-Menten Plot

>> ○ Woolf-Hanes Equation

>> ○ Eadie-Hofstee Equation

>> ○ Lineweaver-Burk Plot **:** Also known as LB plot

>>> ○ x-axis **:** 1 / [S], y-axis **:** 1 / V, x-intercept **:** (-1 / Km , 0), y-intercept **:** (0, 1 / Vm)

>>> ○ [S] ≫ Km **:** V = Vm = kcatE0

>>> ○ [S] ≪ Km **:** V = Vm[S] / Km = kcatE0[S] / Km

> ④ Analysis of Michaelis-Menten Equation

>> ○ Michaelis Constant **:** Referred to as Km

>>> ○ Meaning of Km **:** Substrate concentration corresponding to half of the maximum velocity

>>> ○ Higher Km indicates lower substrate affinity

>> ○ Catalytic Turnover Number **:** Referred to as kcat

>>> ○ Definition **:** Number of substrate molecules converted per enzyme molecule per unit time when the enzyme is saturated with substrate (unit: s^-1)

>>> ○ Equal to Vmax / Etot

>> ○ Catalytic Efficiency or Specificity Constant

**:** Referred to as kcat / Km

>>> ○ kcat ≫ k-1 **:** kcat / Km ∽ k1

>> ○ When all active sites of the enzyme are filled with substrate, the enzyme is saturated, and the reaction is zero-order with V = Vmax.

>> ○ When determining Vm and Km, a range should be chosen where the two points are not too close together and the reciprocal values are not too large (to avoid high errors).

⑵ Inhibitors

> ① Competitive Inhibition **:** Inhibitor competes with the substrate for the active site, thereby slowing down the enzyme reaction.

>> ○ Vm remains constant

>> ○ Km increases

>> ○ y-intercept remains the same in Lineweaver-Burk plot

> ② Uncompetitive Inhibition **:** Inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, slowing down the enzyme reaction.

>> ○ Vm decreases

>> ○ Km decreases

>> ○ Slope remains constant in Lineweaver plot

> ③ Noncompetitive Inhibition **:** Inhibitor binds to a site other than the active site (allosteric site), inhibiting the enzyme reaction noncompetitively.

>> ○ Vm decreases

>> ○ Km remains constant

>> ○ x-intercept remains the same in Lineweaver plot

## **6\. Reaction Rate Factors**

⑴ Collision Theory

> ① Reaction Rate **:** Assumes that chemical reactions occur when molecules collide.

> ② Effective Collision **:** Assumes that reactions actually occur when molecules with sufficient energy collide in the right direction.

> ③ Activation Energy **:** Molecules must pass through an unstable state called the transition state to undergo a reaction, and the energy required for reactants to reach the transition state is referred to as activation energy.

⑵ Effective Collision Frequency

> ① Concentration **:** Increase in concentration → Increase in effective collision frequency → Increase in reaction rate

> ② Pressure (Gas) **:** Increase in pressure → Increase in concentration → Increase in reaction rate

> ③ Surface Area (Solid) **:** Increase in surface area → Increase in effective collision frequency → Increase in reaction rate

⑶ Activation Energy

> ① Minimum energy required to initiate a reaction.

> ② Activity

>> ○ Definition **:** Enhances reaction rate

>> ○ Indicates the extent of reactant conversion

>> ○ **Factor 1:** Conversion rate / Reaction rate

>> ○ **Factor 2:** Turnover number (TON) / Turnover frequency (TOF)

>>> ○ Definition **:** Number of reactant molecules converted per active site per unit time (unit: s^-1 or h^-1)

>>> ○ Typically ranges from 10^-2 to 10^2 s^-1

>>> ○ For enzymes, it ranges from 10^3 to 10^7 s^-1

>> ○ **Factor 3:** Yield **:** Selectivity is determined by yield, and activity is determined by conversion rate.

> ③ Temperature **:** Increase in temperature → Increase in average kinetic energy → Increase in the number of molecules surpassing activation energy → Increase in reaction rate

>> ○ Typically, reaction rate doubles or triples for every 10°C increase.

> ④ Catalyst **:** Does not cause a net change in the amount of reactants before and after the reaction, but alters the reaction pathway, changing activation energy.

>> ○ Positive Catalyst (Catalyst) **:** Decreases activation energy → Increases reaction rate

>> ○ Negative Catalyst (Inhibitor) **:** Increases activation energy → Decreases reaction rate

>> ○ Homogeneous Catalyst **:** When the reactant and the catalyst are in the same phase (e.g., gas, liquid)

>>> ○ Example **:** 2SO2(g) + O2(g) → 2SO3(g) (Catalyst: NO (g))

>> ○ Heterogeneous Catalyst **:** When the reactant and the catalyst are in different phases

**Table 1.** Heterogeneous Catalyst

>>> ○ **Component 1:** Active phase **:** The metal that provides the active site for chemical reactions

>>> ○ **Component 2:** Support / Carrier **:** The metal with a high surface area that disperses and stabilizes the active phase. Increases efficiency, physical strength, selectivity, etc.

>>> ○ **Component 3:** Promoter **:** Enhances catalyst activity, specificity, and lifetime

>>> ○ Example **:** 2SO(g) + O(g) → 2SO3(g) (Catalyst: Pt (s))

>>> ○ Example **:** 2H2O2 (ℓ) → 2H2O (ℓ) + O2 (g) (Catalyst: Manganese Dioxide (MnO2) (s))

> ⑤ Arrhenius Equation

>> ○ A, Ea **:** Arrhenius parameters

>> ○ A **:** Pre-exponential factor

>> ○ Ea **:** Activation energy

>> ○ exp (-Ea / RT) **:** Energy requirement

>> ○ σ vrel NA2 **:** Collision rate

>> ○ P **:** Steric requirement

>>> ○ kexperiment ＜ kexpected

>>> ○ Factors describing direction and arrangement

>>> ○ Always less than 1, sometimes below 10^-6

> ⑥ Multiplying rate constants adds activation energy, and dividing rate constants subtracts activation energy.

> ⑦ (Note) Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) Principle **:** The free activation energy and the free energy of the reaction are proportional.

>> ○ Like Hammond's Postulate, it appears to be an empirical rule.
