## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Visa

> ① A visa is merely a travel document, while the I-94 serves as the document indicating one's status.

> ② There are instances where individuals remain in the U.S. illegally by not leaving the country even after their visa has expired.

⑵ Permanent Residency (Green Card): It is recommended to obtain permanent residency before Trump takes office.

> ① Procedure

>> ○ **Method 1:** Consulting with a law firm 

>> ○ **Method 2:** There is a procedure to obtain a U.S. green card by obtaining a Ph.D.: There is a cheaper way to get a green card other than through a law firm.

>> ○ To acquire a U.S. green card, it is necessary to hire a lawyer and costs more than 5,000 USD, along with a requirement of residing in the U.S. continuously for over a year.

> ② Advantages

>> ○ More opportunities for various fellowships.

>> ○ The cost for a professor to fund a green card graduate student is lower.

> ③ Disadvantages

>> ○ After obtaining the green card, there is a continuous residency requirement to keep it valid, leading many to opt for U.S. citizenship.

>>> ○ Continuous residency requirement: Likely, one cannot leave the U.S. for more than 6 months – to be updated.

>>> ○ South Korea does not allow dual citizenship for those over 65 years of age or those who were not originally U.S. citizens.

>>> ○ Initially applicable only to men, the logic of equity has extended this to women as well.

>>> ○ Due to this, there is a motive to either renounce Korean nationality or reissue the green card.

>> ○ If a company requires having a green card, it is likely not a global company.

⑶ Citizenship (citizenship)

> ① There are standardized requirements for acquiring citizenship

>> ○ **Example 1.** a certain period of employment

>> ○ **Example 2.** When marrying a U.S. citizen, one may also obtain citizenship.

> ② South Korea does not recognize dual citizenship in principle, so acquiring citizenship implies renouncing one's nationality.

>> ○ In my case, I am not interested beyond this point.

>> ○ It's easy to transition from an F1 visa (e.g., U.S. Ph.D.) to H1, but difficult from a J1 visa (e.g., U.S. postdoc) to H1

>>> ○ Reason: J1 visa has a **5-year limitation** + you must return to your home country for 2 years after the visa expires

>> ○ When transferring SEVIS from one U.S. university to another, the F1 visa can still be used, but the J1 visa must be renewed.

>> ○ Stage 2: LCA (Labor Condition Application)

>> ○ Stage 3: I-129: Petition and fee

>> ○ Stage 4: VISA: Visa processing (only necessary for travel)

>> ○ Additional Information:

>>> ○ If your H1B is approved in April, your OPT ends in July, and your H1B starts in October, no additional procedures are necessary.

>>> ○ When transitioning from a J1 to an H1B, keep in mind that if your J1 expires and your H1B is pending, re-entry into the U.S. may be difficult.
