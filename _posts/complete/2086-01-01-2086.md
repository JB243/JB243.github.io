 **Table 1.** GFR Scale

<br>

 ⑸ **Assessment -** RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)

> ① Serves as a biomarker and clinical outcome

> ② Complete Response (CR)

>> ○ All target and non-target lesions are removed

>> ○ Lymph nodes are reduced to < 10 mm

> ③ Partial Response (PR)

>> ○ ≥ 30% reduction in target lesions

>> ○ Non-target lesions don't progress

> ④ Stable Disease (SD)

>> ○ Indeterminate between PR and PD

> ⑤ Progressive Disease (PD)

>> ○ ≥ 20% increase in target lesions or new lesions

 ⑹ **Assessment -** TNM Staging: Evaluates tumor phase

> ① Tumor (T): Differentiated by size and relationship to adjacent cells

> ② Node Metastasis (N): Spread to lymphatic system

> ③ Distant Metastasis (M): Spread through bloodstream

 ⑺ **Prediction -** HER-2 Grading System

> ① Predicts effectiveness of HER-2 targeted treatment by assessing HER-2 expression

 ⑻ **Prognosis -** Gleason's Pattern Scale

<br>

## **3\. Treatment**

 ⑴ **Method 1.** Surgery

> ① Tumor Resection

 ⑵ **Method 2.** Chemotherapy

 ⑶ **Method 3.** Radiotherapy

> ① Type 1. External Beam Radiotherapy

>> ○ IMRT: Current standard

>> ○ 3D CRT: Shape-conforming, but lacks intensity modulation

> ② Type 2. Brachytherapy

 ⑷ **Method 4.** Immunotherapy

> ① Overview**:** Immunotherapies unfortunately work in only about 12.5% of cancer patients.

> ② **Type 1.** Cancer Vaccine

> ③ **1-1.** Preventive Cancer Vaccine: HPV, hepatitis B, only two FDA-approved

>> ○ Voretigene Neparvovec (Luxturna): AAV2-based, expresses _RPE65_ gene

>> ○ Onasemnogene Abeparvovec (Zolgensma): AAV9-based, encodes survival motor neuron (SMN) protein

> ④ **1-2.** [Sipuleucel-T](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1001294): Therapeutic cancer vaccine

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) extracted from patient

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Antigens exposed to APCs in vitro

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Trained APCs reinfused into patient

>> ○ Used in prostate cancer treatment, offers personalized therapy

> ⑤ **Type 2.** CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor)-T Cell Therapy

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. T cells extracted from patient's blood

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. T cells engineered with viral vectors to express CAR

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Expanded to millions of cells

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Infused back into patient for cancer treatment

>> ○ Effective in blood cancers, less so in solid tumors due to tumor microenvironment

> ⑥ **Type 3.** Cytokine: IL-2, interferon-alpha, etc.

> ⑦ **Type 4.** ICI (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor), also known as ICB (Immune Checkpoint Blockade)

>> ○ Principle

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/e7dc0691-fd21-498f-ae86-2817c8eb21bc)

**Figure. 11.** The principle of ICI

<br>

>>> ○ PD-1: Expressed in T cells

>>> ○ CTLA-4: Expressed in T cells

>>> ○ PD-L1: Expressed in macrophages or tumor cells

>>> ○ VISTA: Expressed in T cells, TAM (tumor-associated macrophages), dendritic cells, and other immune cells

>>> ○ Siglec: The Siglec family in immune cells binds to sialylated glycans on cancer cells, acting as an immune checkpoint

>>> ○ MYC: Overexpression of MYC is involved in immune suppression

>> ○ **Type 1.** PD-1 inhibitor

>>> ○ nivolumab (Opdivo)

>>> ○ pembrolizumab (Keytruda, approved for TNBC patients)

>>> ○ cemiplimab (Libtayo)

>> ○ **Type 2.** PD-L1 inhibitor

>>> ○ atezolizumab (Tecentriq, approved for TNBC patients)

>>> ○ avelumab (Bavencio)

>>> ○ durvalumab (Imfinzi)

>>> ○ atezolizumab

>> ○ **Type 3.** CTLA-4 inhibitor

>>> ○ ipilimumab (the first ICI discovered)

>> ○ Advantages

>>> ○ Universally applicable regardless of cancer type

>>> ○ Received FDA approval for mutation burden: This universality was a first

>> ○ Disadvantages

>>> ○ Immune-related adverse effect: Can cause autoimmune diseases

>>> ○ Shows a response rate of approximately 20-40%: Attempts targeted therapy using mutation burden and other biomarkers

>>> ○ Ineffective for cold tumors like glioblastoma

>>> ○ Expensive

>>> ○ PD-L1 sensitivity may continuously change during treatment

>> ○ Treatment

>>> ○ Better treated with anti-PD1/L1 therapy than with anti-CTLA-4 therapy → Anti-PD1, anti-PDL1 drugs are dominating

>>> ○ FDA approval condition: Prescribed for solid tumors when specific conditions such as MSI-H (microsatellite instability), MMR (mismatch-repair gene) are met.

 ⑸ **Method 5.** Photodynamic Therapy

> ① PS (Photosensitizer)

> ② Type I Reaction: PS → 1PS* (singlet state) → 3PS* (triplet state)

>> ○ 1PS* and 3PS* generate radicals, causing tissue damage

> ③ Type II Reaction: 3PS* + O2 → PS + 1O2*

>> ○ 1O2* (singlet oxygen) causes tissue damage

> ④ Drawbacks include low oxygen efficiency in type II reaction, toxicity of PS, and sensitivity to light

> ⑤ PS in the skin can be damaged by sunlight, light penetration is an issue
