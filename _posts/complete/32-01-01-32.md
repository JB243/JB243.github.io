 ⑴ **Case 1.** t ＜ 0

**Figure 2.** Situation when t ＜ 0

> ① The circuit above is a stable circuit.

>> ○ Meaning **:** Voltage and current converge.

>> ○ Justification **:** Consists only of voltage sources.

>> ○ When t = 0-, the inductor can be considered a short circuit, and the capacitor an open circuit.

> ② Proof

>> ○ The capacitor is at a lower position (ⓐ) in the voltage gradient, so the charge accumulates, but the voltage cannot exceed that of the open-circuited state.

>> ○ The voltage of the capacitor, exceeding the voltage of the open-circuited state, would act like a battery → Contradiction at ⓐ.

>> ○ The capacitor is always stable in a circuit composed only of constant voltage sources.

>> ○ [Example of an unstable capacitor](https://jb243.github.io/pages/30) ]

>> ○ Completeness Axiom **:** An increasing and bounded function always converges.

> ③ Initial Conditions
