## 1\. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

 ⑴ Oxidizing Agents: Substances that are reduced themselves and oxidize other substances

> ① K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>

> ② H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>

> ③ CrO<sub>3</sub>

> ④ KMnO<sub>4</sub>

> ⑤ Jones reagent: CrO<sub>3</sub> / aq. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>

> ⑥ PCC: Mild oxidizing agent

>> ○ Primary alcohols → Aldehydes

>> ○ Secondary alcohols → Ketones

>> ○ Tertiary alcohols → No reaction

> ⑦ DMP (Dess-Martin periodinane)

> ⑧ HOCl

> ⑨ NaOCl / CH3COOH / 0 ℃

> ⑩ Swern oxidation reagent

> ⑪ Collins reagent

> ⑫ Magtrieve oxidant (CrO<sub>2</sub>)

> ⑬ TEMPO

> ⑭ Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>

> ⑮ NaIO<sub>4</sub>

⑵ Reducing Agents: Substances that are oxidized themselves and reduce other substances

> ① Overview

>> ○ Reducing agents are typically nucleophiles and change oxidation states

>> ○ NaH and similar compounds are bases and do not change oxidation states

> ② H<sub>2</sub> / Pt, Pd or Ni

> ③ [Lindlar catalyst](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1363#:~:text=syn%20%EC%B2%A8%EA%B0%80%20%EB%B0%98%EC%9D%91%20%3A-,Lindlar,-%EC%B4%89%EB%A7%A4%20\(P%2D2)

>> ○ Catalyst consisting of Pd, CaCO<sub>3</sub> (or BaSO<sub>4</sub>), lead (Ⅱ) acetate ((CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>)<sub>2</sub>Pb<sup>2+</sup>), quinoline, etc.

> ④ LiAlH<sub>4</sub> and NaBH<sub>4</sub>

>> ○ LiAlH<sub>4</sub> (LAH): Strong reducing agent

>>> ○ Carboxylic acids → Primary alcohols

>>> ○ Aldehydes → Primary alcohols

>>> ○ Ketones → Secondary alcohols

>>> ○ Consider steric hindrance in reduction reactions

>> ○ NaBH<sub>4</sub>: Weak reducing agent

>>> ○ Carboxylic acids → No reaction

>>> ○ Aldehydes → Primary alcohols

>>> ○ Ketones → Secondary alcohols

>> ○ Why LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is stronger than NaBH<sub>4</sub>

>>> ○ **Reason 1:** Unlike B, Al is in the 3<sup>rd</sup> period, making it easier for hydrogen to leave

>>> ○ **Reason 2:** Al has lower electronegativity, resulting in a larger δ<sup>-</sup> for H

>>> ○ LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reacts vigorously with H<sub>2</sub>O, so simultaneous addition of H<sub>2</sub>O should be avoided: LAH is mainly used with THF solvent

> ⑤ Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>

## **2\. Organometallic Reagents**

⑴ Overview

> ① Organometallic reagents perform carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions

> ② Metal ions in compounds carry δ<sup>+</sup> charge, alkyl groups carry δ<sup>-</sup> charge

⑵ Grignard Reagents: RMgX

> ① Preparation: RX + Mg (catalyst: anhydrous ether) → RMgX

> ② **Reaction**: In RMgX, Mg becomes δ<sup>+</sup> leading to strong negative charge on R, which connects to electrophilic carbons

>> ○ Phosgene (phosgen), carbonate ester: reacts

<br>

> ③ Grignard reagents react with carbons that have low steric hindrance

> ④ Limitation in Organic Halides

>> ○ Organic bromides and organic iodides: Grignard reagents are easily formed

>> ○ Organic fluorides: Grignard reagents are hardly formed

> ④ Alcohol [Protection Reactions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1372) (_e.g._, tosylation, mesylation)

>> ○ If an acid hydrogen is present in RX, Mg acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the hydrogen (common with alcohols)

>> ○ Thus, alcohols are protected from Mg via alcohol protection reactions

⑶ Alkyl Lithium Reagents: RLi

> ① Preparation

> ② **Reaction**: In RLi, Li becomes δ<sup>+</sup> leading to strong negative charge on R, which connects to electrophilic carbons

>> ○ Alkyl lithium reagents can react with carboxylic acids unlike Grignard reagents and Gilman reagents

⑷ Gilman Reagents: R<sub>2</sub>CuLi

> ① Preparation: 2RLi + CuI (catalyst: anhydrous ether) → R<sub>2</sub>CuLi

> ② **Reaction**: In R<sub>2</sub>CuLi, CuLi becomes δ<sup>+</sup> leading to strong negative charge on R. Connects to an electrophilic carbon of a _single_ R

>> ○ Gilman reagents do not react with carbonyl groups (C=O)

>> ○ Exception: In the case of β-halo carbonyl E1cB, a carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction occurs at a remote alkene position from the ketone
