## **1. Munsell Color System** 

**Figure. 1.** Munsell Color System 

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Devised by the American painter Albert H. Munsell in 1905

> ② Modified by the Optical Society of America's Colorimetry Committee in 1943 and widely used internationally

 ⑵ Three elements of color

> ① Hue: Differentiated color categories

> ② Chroma: Clarity, purity, and intensity of a color, also referred to as saturation

> ③ Lightness or brightness: The degree of lightness or darkness of a color

 ⑶ Color representation

**Figure. 2.** Color representation in the Munsell Color System [Footnote: 2]

> ① Based on the primary colors of red, yellow, green, blue, and purple, with additional colors such as orange, lime, turquoise, teal, and violet, totaling 10 colors

> ② Each color is divided into 10 steps, resulting in 100 colors. The 5th step represents the primary color

> ③ Significance: Achieving objective scientific representation of color through the three attributes of hue, lightness, and chroma

> ④ **Limitation 1:** Gaps between colors are not strictly defined, especially for blue

> ⑤ **Limitation 2:** Variation in chroma positions makes color mixing difficult

 ⑷ Lightness representation

> ① Assigned values from 0 to 10: 0 represents black, and 10 represents white

> ② For achromatic colors, "N" is prefixed, followed by an appropriate value

 ⑸ Chroma representation

> ① Centered on the achromatic axis, numbered from 0, increasing horizontally with higher saturation

## **2. Ostwald Color System** 

 ⑴ Devised by the German chemist Friedrich W. Ostwald

 ⑵ Color representation

> ① All colors are represented using the sum of white amount (W), black amount (B), and pure color amount (C), normalized to 100

> ② Using yellow, red, blue, and green as primary colors, with orange, violet, magenta, and cyan in between, divided into 24 equidistant complementary colors

> ③ Advantages: Developed with consideration of color and human physiological aspects

> ④ Disadvantages: Color names are difficult to understand in the representation. Lack of clear relationships between colors hampers practical use

 ⑶ Lightness and chroma representation: Not separately represented in the Ostwald color system

<br>

<br>

## **3. CIE Standard Colorimetric System** 

 ⑴ Established by the Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage (CIE) in 1931

 ⑵ A scientific color system reflecting both physical light quantities and human perceptual qualities

 ⑶ **Advantage 1:** Can express source illuminants' color unlike Munsell or Ostwald systems that are limited to object colors

 ⑷ **Advantage 2:** Independent of human perception

<br>

<br>

## **4. CIE RGB Color System**

 ⑴ Color matching experiments: Conducted actively in the early 20th century using three primary colors

> ① 1st: RGB primary wavelengths defined as 700.0, 546.1, and 435.8 nm

> ② 2nd: White screen divided into reference and test surfaces

> ③ 3rd: Illumination of reference surface with three independent brightness-adjustable primary lights

> ④ 4th: Illumination of test surface with specific test light wavelength, adjusting reference surface's primary lights to match brightness

> ⑤ 5th: Color matching: Standard observer judges if mixed color matches test color

> ⑥ 6th: Averaging results from multiple observers: Called color-matching functions

> ⑦ Example 1: Mixing approximately 80 W of R primary light and 0.4 W of G primary light creates the same color as 1 W of orange light at 600 nm

> ⑧ Example 2: Mixing R primary light, G primary light, and B primary light in ratios 243.9 W:4.697 W:3.505 W produces white

 ⑵ Tristimulus curves: Defined to satisfy the following

**Figure. 3.** Tristimulus curves in terms of primary units [Footnote: 3]

> ① E: Spectrum entering the observer's eye

> ② R, G, B: Primary lights

> ③ Drawback: Contains negative values, leading to inconveniences

 ⑶ [RGB to gray](https://www.dynamsoft.com/blog/insights/image-processing/image-processing-101-color-space-conversion/)

> ① **Method 1:** gray = (R + G + B) / 3

> ② **Method 2:** gray = 0.2989 R + 0.5870 G + 0.1140 B

<br>

<br>

## **5. CIE XYZ Color System**

 ⑴ Tristimulus curves: Defined as follows

**Figure. 4.** Tristimulus curves in the CIE XYZ Color System 

> ① S(λ): Spectral radiance based on wavelength λ

> ② I(λ): Spectral reflectance based on wavelength λ, ranging from 0% to 100%

> ③ E(λ): Spectrum entering the observer's eye

> ④ K: Scaling Factor, ranging from 1 to 100

> ⑤ Generally, integration is performed for visible wavelengths λ ∈ [380, 780]

 ⑵ Experimental process

**Figure. 5.** Experimental process in the CIE XYZ Color System 

 ⑶ CIE Color Coordinates (x, y, z) are normalized versions of X, Y, Z

 ⑷ Relationship between RGB tristimulus and XYZ tristimulus

> ① Matrix transformation

> ② (Comment) The relationship between RGB and XYZ tristimulus seems non-linear; thus, the above formula might not be suitable
