## **2. Solution 1. **

 ⑴ Time constant (time constant) = L / R

 ⑵ **Memory tip** **:** The unit of L/R is time (t)

 ⑶ iL is always continuous with respect to time

 ⑷ When enough time passes, vL = 0

 ⑸ When enough time passes, the coil can be considered as shorted (closed)

 ⑹ All conductors have an L value **:** In the case of wires, the L value is very small, so its effect can be ignored

## **4\. Energy**

 ⑴ Energy supplied by the power source **:** W ＜ 0

 ⑵ Energy stored in the coil **:** W ＞ 0

 ⑶ Energy consumed through the resistor **:** W ＞ 0

 ⑷ Law of conservation of energy
