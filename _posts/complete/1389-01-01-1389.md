## **1\. Monosaccharides**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Monosaccharides exhibit linear structures in the solid state and cyclic structures in aqueous solution.

>> ○ Mechanism: Nucleophilic addition reaction of aldehydes

>> ○ Linear structure in glucose: Oxygen at position e attacks carbon at position 1, forming a cyclic structure.

>> ○ Convex face approach (outside attack), concave face approach (inside attack)

> ② All monosaccharides are reducing sugars: They have strong reducing abilities and are easily oxidized themselves.

⑵ Glucose, Fructose, Galactose, Mannose

> ① Isomeric relationship: Glucose, fructose, galactose, and mannose have the same composition but different structures.

> ② Galactose: Differs only in the arrangement of the 4th carbon from glucose.

> ③ Aldoses: Monosaccharides with an aldehyde group, strong tendency to undergo oxidation through carbonyl group

>> ○ Examples: Glucose, galactose, mannose

> ④ Ketoses: Monosaccharides with a ketone group, strong stability

>> ○ Example: Fructose (contributes to non-reducing sugar property of sucrose)

> ⑤ HFCS (High-Fructose Corn Syrup)

>> ○ Approximately half of glucose converted to fructose using isomerase enzyme

>> ○ Fructose much sweeter than glucose
