## **1\. Huygens' Principle** (also called Huygens' construction)

 ⑴ Principle: Every point on a wavefront becomes a source of new wavefront

 ⑵ Principle of rectilinear propagation

> ① In modern quantum optics, atoms become point sources

> ② Question: If photons are absorbed by atoms and then re-emitted, why does light travel in straight lines? Why doesn't it go backward?

> ③ Answer: Similar to how shockwaves exhibit reinforcement interference in the forward direction but destructive interference in other paths

 ⑶ Law of reflection

> ① Proof

**Figure 1.** Proof of the law of reflection based on Huygens' principle [Footnote: 1]

>> ○ **Assumption 1:** Due to the principle of rectilinear propagation, points O, P'', Q'' have the same phase

>> ○ **Assumption 2:** Waves O', P', Q' emitted from O, P'', Q'' after the same time have the same phase

>> ○ **Assumption 3:** Points O, P, Q have the same phase difference

>> ○ Conclusion: θ = θ'

> ② Light that doesn't follow the law of reflection disappears due to destructive interference

> ③ Fixed end reflection: Reflection from a region with lower refractive index to a region with higher refractive index

>> ○ Phase of the wave changes by π

> ④ Free end reflection: Reflection from a region with higher refractive index to a region with lower refractive index

>> ○ Phase of the wave remains unchanged

 ⑷ Law of refraction

> ① Interpretation based on the wave nature of light

**Figure 2.** Proof of the law of refraction based on Huygens' principle [Footnote: 2]

>> ○ **Assumption 1:** Due to the principle of rectilinear propagation, points O, P'', Q'' have the same phase

>> ○ **Assumption 2:** Waves O', P', Q' emitted from O, P'', Q'' after the same time have the same phase

>> ○ **Assumption 3:** Points O, P, Q have the same phase difference

>> ○ **Assumption 4:** Define the time difference between O and Q as Δt

>> ○ Conclusion

> ② Interpretation based on the particle nature of light

>> ○ Light that doesn't follow the law of refraction disappears due to destructive interference

>> ○ Law of refraction can be analyzed from the energy-momentum perspective of photons

> ③ **Example 1:** Refraction of light by water: Objects appear shallower than their actual depth in water

> ④ **Example 2:** Refraction of light by lenses: Detailed description in [Geometrical Optics](https://jb243.github.io/pages/745)

> ⑤ **Example 3:** Refraction of light by the atmosphere

>> ○ Mirage phenomenon

>>> ○ Light travels slower in air with higher temperature

>>> ○ Cold air above, hot air below: Light from the sky passes through a layer of hot air and becomes visible

>>> ○ Cold air below, hot air above: Light from above bends downward, making objects appear suspended in the air

>> ○ Phenomenon of the sun being visible below the horizon during sunrise and sunset

>> ○ Phenomenon of the sun appearing elliptical near the horizon: Sun near the horizon appears elliptical

>> ○ Fata Morgana

>> ○ Twinkling stars

 ⑸ Principle of diffraction

 ⑹ Cherenkov radiation

> ① Phenomenon where charged particles move through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium, emitting light

> ② Can be explained by reinforcement interference based on Huygens' principle
