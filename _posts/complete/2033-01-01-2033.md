⑷ Population structure

> ① Population structure **:** Characteristics of density and spatial distribution

> ② Measurement of population size **:** Census, mark-recapture method, quadrant method, transect method, sample plots, etc.

>> ○ **Quadrant method** **:** Placing a quadrant frame in the survey area to count individuals

**Figure. 1.** Quadrant method 

>>> ○ _Density = Number of individuals ÷ Total area_ **:** A is 10/25, B is 4/25, C is 6/25

>>> ○ _Relative density = Number of individuals ÷ Total population size_ **:** A is 10/20, B is 4/20, C is 6/20

>>> ○ _Frequency = Number of times the species appeared in the sample ÷ Total number of samples_ **:** A is 6/25, B is 4/25, C is 6/25

>>> ○ _Cover = Area occupied by a species ÷ Total area_

>>> ○ Importance **:** Sum of relative density, relative frequency, and relative cover

>>> ○ Species richness

>>> ○ Species diversity

>>> ○ **Dominant species** **:** The most abundant species that has the greatest impact. These species have high biomass or numerous individuals and exert significant effects on the community.

>>> ○ **Keystone species** **:** Species that have a disproportionately large effect on their environment despite their low abundance. They play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem structure and function.

>>> ○ Indicator species **:** Species that are indicative of a specific community or habitat condition.

>>> ○ Rare species **:** Species with low abundance within a community.

>>> ○ Foundation species **:** Species whose presence influences the presence of other species. Their removal can lead to the extinction of other species.

>>> ○ Pioneer species **:** Species that create a new habitat environment (e.g., beavers)

③ Spatial distribution of populations

>> ○ Clumped distribution **:** High density where resources are abundant

>> ○ Uniform distribution **:** Species that establish territories

>> ○ Random distribution **:** Species with wide environmental tolerances, no specific factors for distribution

④ **Limitation 1.** Excessive population growth leads to high mortality rates: High risk of extinction

>> ○ Density-dependent factors **:** Resource scarcity, increased disease, pollution

>> ○ Density-independent factors **:** Droughts, extreme temperatures, natural disasters, etc.

>> ○ Demographic lag **:** Time interval between the decrease in birth rate and the decrease in population growth rate

⑵ Logistic population growth model **:** Complements **Limitation 1.**

> ① The growth rate of the population per unit time depends on the population size and environmental resistance

>> ○ Carrying capacity (K) **:** Maximum population that an environment can sustain

>> ○ Environmental resistance **:** Corresponds to 1 - K/N for population size N

>> ○ ∴ dN/dt = rN(1 - N/K)

> ② r-selection: High population growth rate, small body size, large number of offspring, short generation time

>> ○ Environmental resistance approaches 0, follows a J-shaped exponential growth model to some extent **:** Density-dependent growth

>> ○ Characteristics of J-shaped curve. Emphasis on reproduction. Short lifespan, small body size

> ③ K-selection: Low population growth rate, large body size, fewer high-quality offspring

>> ○ Population growth rate nears 0 as the population approaches the carrying capacity (K)

>> ○ Long lifespan, large body size, iteroparity, extended development time, intense competition between individuals

>> ○ Organisms under K-selection tend to reproduce at a later age. Fewer offspring and smaller population size

**Figure. 2.** Population growth models

(A) represents the exponential growth model, (B) represents the logistic population growth model

⑷ Demographic transition **:** Growth rate increases due to a decrease in death rate despite no change in birth rate

> ① Pre-industrial revolution: Both birth and death rates were high in most countries

> ② Post-industrial revolution: Improved hygiene and medical advances led to a decrease in death rate

> ③ The time delay between death and birth rates significantly affects population size

> ④ Many developing countries are in the demographic transition phase → Pursuit of population control policies

> ⑤ Developed countries have transitioned, resulting in low population growth rates → Focus on childcare, education, welfare, and immigration policies

>>> ○ **Characteristic 1:** Competition frequency with other habitats is higher at the edge.

>>> ○ **Characteristic 2:** If the habitat was a forest, increased wind influence, temperature increase, humidity decrease, and light intensity increase.

>>> ○ As a result, edge species originating from adjacent areas have an advantage in inhabiting the edge rather than internal species.

>> ○ **Supplement 5:** Habitat Fragmentation

>>> ○ Definition **:** Gradual destruction of habitats due to human activities, resulting in smaller and isolated habitats.

>>> ○ **Outcome 1:** Only populations of organisms that can survive in small habitats can persist.

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Small population → inbreeding, genetic instability

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Inbreeding, genetic instability → loss of genetic diversity

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Loss of genetic diversity → decreased adaptability and population fitness

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Decreased adaptability and population fitness → high mortality, low reproduction

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. High mortality, low reproduction → smaller population

>> ○ Potato famine mechanism
