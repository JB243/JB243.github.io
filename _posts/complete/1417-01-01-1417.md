## **1. Structure of Hair**

⑴ One strand of hair = macrofibril × n. Hair diameter is 100 ㎛.

⑵ One macrofibril = microfibril × 100-999.

⑶ One microfibril = protofibril × 11.

⑷ Protofibril = α-keratin × 3.

⑸ α-keratin: A single polypeptide. Alpha-helix structure.

<br>

<br>

## **2. Step 1.** Initial State

⑴ α-keratin is connected to neighboring α-keratin by disulfide bonds.

<br>

<br>

## **3. Step 2.** Chemical Treatment

⑴ Use of a reducing agent: Converts disulfide bonds to sulfhydryl groups (-SH groups). Inhibits hydrogen bonds and disrupts the alpha-helix structure.

⑵ The reducing agent reaction requires heat.

⑶ Hydrogen bonds: Involved in secondary and tertiary structures of proteins. Temporarily and holistically involved in protein structure.

⑷ Disulfide bonds: Involved in tertiary structures of proteins. Semi-permanently maintain structure.

<br>

<br>

## **4. Step 3.** Curl

⑴ Physically deformed to change bonding positions.

<br>

<br>

## **5. Step 4.** Sulfur Neutralization

⑴ Oxidizing agent: Neutralizes the initial dye. Converts sulfhydryl groups back to disulfide bonds.

⑵ The oxidizing agent reaction does not require heat.
