## **1\. DNA and Chromosomes**

⑴ DNA binds to proteins to form a dye (= chromatin) and contains many genes.

> ① Cationic amino acids, such as histidine, condense negatively charged DNA.

> ② Heterochromatin: Condensed chromatin

> ③ Euchromatin: Loose chromatin

⑵ Chromosome: Chromatin condenses into a form that is visible under an optical microscope.

> ① Number of chromosomes = Number of chunks acting as one = Number of chunks that are dyed together

> ② The number of chromosomes is equal to the number of centromeres, except in the case of tetravalent chromosomes.

> ③ The short arm and long arm of a chromosome are referred to as the P arm and Q arm, respectively.

⑶ Karyotype: Refers to the shape, size and number of chromosomes. Species-specific.

<br>

> ① Chemicals are used to halt cells in metaphase during cell division for observation.

⑷ Sister chromatids: Chromatids that are bound together at the centromere after the replication of an unreplicated chromosome.

> ① The number of sister chromosomes is the number of DNA.

> ② Centromere: Possesses a binding site for dynein motor proteins and a kinetochore.

> ③ Bivalent Chromosome (Tetrad): A chromosome containing four sister chromatids. In this case, four sister chromatids are attached to the centromere.

>> ○ Homologous chromosomes do not share centromeres: The reason why the number of chromosomes does not always equal the number of centromeres.

>> ○ 1 bivalent chromosome = 1 tetrad = 2 chromosomes = 4 sister chromatids.

> ④ Univalent Chromosome (Dyad): A chromosome containing two sister chromatids. In this case, two sister chromatids are attached to the centromere.

>> ○ 1 univalent chromosome = 1 dyad = 1 chromosome = 2 sister chromatids.

> ⑤ Nullivalent Chromosome (Monad): A chromosome containing a single chromatid, which corresponds to a single strand of double-stranded DNA.

>> ○ This is the form of chromosomes in gametes.

>> ○ 1 nullivalent chromosome = 0 chromosomes = 1 sister chromatid.

⑸ Homologous and sex chromosomes

> ① Homologous chromosome (autosome): Same size, shape, centroid position, relative locus (locus, locus)

> ② Sex chromosome: Different positions, genetic makeup, partial homology

> ③ Example: Humans have 22 pairs of autosomal and 1 pair of sex chromosomes

> ④ Example: Human germ cells have 22 autosomal and 1 sex chromosomes

⑹ Cell division involved protein

> ① condensin (condensin): Condensing Dyed Yarns to Chromosomes

> ② Cohesion: Each chromosome binds to each other, only cohesins exist near the centromere

> ③ Shugosin: Do not decompose homologous chromosomes in 1meiosis

> ④ Securin: Inhibition of seperase, prevention of separation of sister chromosome until late cell division

>> ○ It acts on mitosis, meiosis and meiosis

>> ○ APC Inhibits Securin

> ⑤ seperase (seperase): Decomposition of cohesins of isotope subgroups, and separation of sister chromosome in late cell division

>> ○ It acts on mitosis, meiosis and meiosis

⑺ Mitotic spindle

> ① Spinal cord is composed of microtubules

> ② Spinal cord attachment point (kinetochore): Structure that protein binds to isotope

> ③ Kinetochore microtubule: Dynein, spindle splice bound to chromosomes, involved in late chromosomal migration

> ④ Nonkinetochore microtubule: Pair of kinesins, spindles with opposite spindles, involved in terminal cell extension

>> ○ One kinesin of each polar spine sticks together and pushes each other

> ⑤ Astral Skewers: Later transfer of centroids to the anode

> ⑥ Chromosomal Arm Skewers: Spinal cord attached to the arm of chromosome, rotating the chromosome later in order to orient it properly

⑻ Reagent

> ① Gimsa: Better staining on A-T rich sites with fewer bindings on chromosomes

> ② Acetic acid alcohol: Fixed to prevent cell division

> ③ Hydroxy Urea: Unite all cells into G1

> ④ Acridine orange: DNA double helix broken

> ⑤ Phytohemagglutinin (PHA): Convert neutrophils into neutrophils blasts to induce division and differentiation and use for karyotyping

>> ○ Missense mutation (mistake mutation): Change to another amino acid code due to alternative base

>> ○ Nonsense Mutations (Stop Mutations): Loss of meaning (shortened length) due to password being changed to a stop codon

>> ○ Neutral mutation: Change to amino acids of similar nature

>> ○ XO (Turner Syndrome): 1/5000 birth, 99% natural abortion, dwarf, sexual incomplete maturity

> ④ Drainage: Mutations in which the number of chromosomes increases in multiples of n

>> ○ autopolyploidy (autopolyploidy): 2n (plant) individuals become 4n individuals and then breed 2n species to create 3n objects

>>> ○ Colchicine: Spindle polymerization inhibitors bind to tubulin dimers and stop cell division in the middle phase

>>> ○ Often, autopolyploidy is made using colchicine for breeding purposes.

>>> ○ Taxol: Spinach depolymerization inhibitor used as anticancer agent

>> ○ Heteroploidy (heteroploidy, diploidy, allopolyploidy): (Plant) individuals by breeding between nearby species

>>> ○ Mechanism of evolution

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Create AB object between AA and BB objects

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. If the AB entity is an odd chromosome, there is no fertility, so the fertility can be restored, ie AABB production

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Create AABB objects that can breed between AABB and AABB objects

>> ○ **Example 1.** Seedless Watermelon (3n)

>> ○ **Example 2.** Triploid (3n) is 1% to 3% of total pregnancy → most of them cannot give birth and cannot survive

⑺ Cell Cycle Regulatory Genes and Cancer

> ① Proto-oncogenes (proto-oncogenes)

>> ○ Genes that regulate the cell cycle often encode growth factors

>> ○ **Example 1.** Growth factor or its receptor protein gene (HER2 of ovarian cancer / breast cancer)

>> ○ **Example 2.** _Ras_ (rat sarooma)

>>> ○ Activated by tyrosine kinase

>>> ○ Involved in signal transduction pathway by acting as GPCR

>>> ○ GTpase activating protein loss → Ras overactivity

>> ○ **Example 3.** _c-myc_

>>> ○ Recombination → expression ↑ → lymphoma development on the chromosome that the c-myc gene encodes the antibody gene

>> ○ **Example 4.** _abl-bcr_ (note. 5-⑵-①)

>> ○ **Example 5.** _c-erbB, c-mx, c-kit, RARa, Eb_, cyclin, CDK 2, 4

>> ○ Tumor genes correspond to accelerators

>> ○ Dominant expression: Mutation on one homologous chromosome results in mutation symptoms

> ② Oncogene: DNA changes due to mutations in the oncogenes

>> ○ Mutations in tumor genes promote excessive cell division even without growth factors

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. DNA base mutants are highly active due to structural or functional changes of the coding protein

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Overexpression by amplification or rearrangement of genes

>> ○ **Example 1.** Ras gene

>>> ○ Mutations in genes can lead to the development of cancer cells

>>> ○ Growth Factor Independent Cleavage

> ③ Tumor suppressor gene

>> ○ Protein genes that stop cell division or repair damaged DNA at cell cycle checkpoints

>> ○ Recessive expression: Mutation symptoms must be mutated to all homologous chromosomes

>> ○ **Example 1.** _BRCA2_ gene

>>> ○ Located on chromosome 13, coding for a protein involved in repairing DNA damage

>>> ○ Related to Breast Cancer

>> ○ **Example 2.** _p53_ gene: Act throughout the cell cycle,

>>> ○ _p21_ transcription increase

>>> ○ Associated with the expression of specific miRNAs that inhibit cell division

>>> ○ Activation of gene expression directly involved in DNA repair

>>> ○ Inhibition of Cyclin-CDK Complex on DNA Damage

>>> ○ Can induce apoptosis

>> ○ **Example 3.** pRb1: Acts on G1, inhibits E2F

>> ○ **Example 4.** bcl2: Bax Suppression

>> ○ **Example 5.** APC (Note. 3-⑴)

>> ○ **Example 6.** RB Protein: Substances that prevent the cell cycle from progressing

> ④ Multiple collision model

>> ○ Benign tumor when the primary tumor gene is mutated to normal cells (≠ cancer)

>> ○ Malignant tumor when tumor suppressor gene is mutated in both maternal and paternal tumors (= cancer)

>> ○ At least 5-6 independent mutations are required in a cell: 10 ~ 20 years

> ⑤ Cancer outbreaks require multiple mutations

>> ○ Benign tumors must accumulate many mutations in order to progress to cancer (∴ frequent in epithelial tissues with frequent cell division)

>> ○ Angiogenesis: Tumors give you blood.

>> ○ Loss of contact and anchorage dependence: Cells are layered, cancer cells can move to other locations

>> ○ Loss of density-dependent inhibition

>> ○ Immortalization: Telomerase activation does not limit cell division.

>> ○ Mutations are inherited, most mutations are produced during the lifetime of the person

⑻ Immortalization Mechanisms of Cancer Cells

> ① Telomerace presence

> ② Protects telomere DNA at the end of chromosome and continues to divide more than 50 times normal cells

⑼ Colorectal cancer, colorectal cancer: One of the most cancers

> ① APC Tumor Suppressor Gene Defects: Polyp formation (polyp) due to excessive epithelial cell proliferation (polar, loss of contact inhibition)

>> ○ Colorectal cancer is often found by mutations in a gene called the family adenoma polyp (APC)

>> ○ APC Gene Mutations Are Recessive

> ② Ras Tumor Gene: Cell proliferation without signal, production of small benign tumors (class II adenoma, adenoma)

>> ○ Growth factor-independent division of cancer is mostly due to Ras

> ③ Tumor Suppressor Gene DCC (deleted in colon cancer)

> ④ Tumor suppressor gene _p53_ deletion: Failure of G1/S identification points related to DNA damage, rapid accumulation of mutations, generation of malignancies

> ⑤ Deletion of the Antitransduction Gene: Metastasis, infiltration into other organs

> ⑥ Order is not important and cancer is generated if conditions are met

## **6. Cancer discovery and treatment**

⑴ Discovery method

> ① Cancer antigen 125 (CA125)

>> ○ Amino acid sequence of 22,000aa, also known as mucin 16 or MUC 16

>> ○ Cellular glycoprotein of epithelial cancer with tumor antigen (CA125) recognized by monoclonal antibody, OC-125 (ovarian cancer antibody)

>> ○ Normal value of CA 125 in serum: Less than 35U / ml

>> ○ Therapeutic Effect of Ovarian Cancer, the Only Tumor Marker in Early Detection of Relapse

>> ○ Prognostic Determination and Correlation with Size, Stage, and Survival of Ovarian Cancer.

>> ○ CA125 may also increase in ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer, so the screening value is low

> ② Biopsy: Surgically harvesting cells or tissues

>> ○ Injection biopsy: With a needle

>> ○ Laparoscopic: Illuminator, camera, small knife surgical tool

> ③ X-ray diagnostics

>> ○ Common tumor: 108 cells

>> ○ Palpation tumor (10 mm): 109 cells

>> ○ Death tumor (10 cm): 1012 cells

⑵ How to treat

> ① Local tumors can be removed by surgery.  

> ② Chemotherapy: Chemicals that kill dividing cells (cancer drugs)

>> ○ Cocktail Therapy: Use of various cell division inhibitory chemicals

>> ○ Resistant cells: 1/100 million. 1000 resistant cells in palpable tumors

>> ○ Side effects of killing normally dividing cells (all cells, bone marrow, stomach wall): Hair loss, vomiting, diarrhea

> ③ Radiation therapy: Use high energy radiation

>> ○ Death of cancer cells by damaging DNA (BRCA2, p53)

>> ○ Usually used for nearby cancer

>> ○ Typically 10-20 radiation treatments after surgical removal of the tumor

>> ○ Normal cells → normal cell division (by p53, DNA repair) or apoptosis

>> ○ Tumor cell → cell death (**∵** mutation increase) or malignant tumor

⑶ Cancer risk factors: Factors that increase cancer incidence

> ① Smoking: Tobacco contains several carcinogens, increasing free radicals, damaging DNA

> ② High fat, low fiber eating habits

> ③ Lack of exercise leads to an unhealthy immune system and an increased risk of cancer from obesity

> ④ Drinking: Alcohol and tobacco increase the risk with the law of multiplication

> ⑤ Aging: Immune system worsens, mutations accumulate

> ⑥ Frequent cell division

>> ○ Recovery of damage after ovarian ovulation

>> ○ Recovery of frictional damage from gut epithelial movement

> ⑦ Radioactive material, near power cable: Increased incidence of leukemia
