## **1.** **Nomenclature**

⑴ There are IUPAC nomenclature and common names.

⑵ Alcohol (R-O-H) nomenclature

> ① Determine the longest carbon chain (ring) structure containing the alcohol as the parent structure.

> ② Number each carbon starting from the carbon closest to the -OH group in the carbon chain.

> ③ If there are substituents, name them in alphabetical order.

> ④ In cases of mixtures of alkyl, halo, alkene, and alkyne groups, the priority of functional groups is as follows:

>> ○ -OH > Alkene > Alkyne (if alkene and number are the same) > Halogen

> ⑤ Common names

>> ○ Example: propyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, sec-butyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, neopentyl alcohol

⑶ Polyols (polyalcohols): More than 2 alcohols

> ① Attach suffixes like -diol, -triol to the end of the main chain's name.

> ② Assign lower numbers to provide at least one alcohol with a smaller number, and name them alphabetically.

> ③ Common names: ethylene glycol (ethane-1,2-diol), glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol)

<br>

<br>

## **2.** **Physical Properties**

⑴ Degree of alcohols

> ① Definition: The degree of carbon with an attached -OH group.

> ② Higher degree of alcohol → Lower solubility in water

> ③ Higher degree of alcohol → Increased intermolecular forces → Decreased melting and boiling points

>> ○ Boiling points: 1-butanol (117 ℃) > 2-methyl-1-propanol (107 ℃) > 2-butanol (98 ℃) > 2-methyl-2-propanol (82 ℃)

>> ○ Melting points: 1-butanol (-90 ℃) > 2-methyl-1-propanol (-108 ℃) > 2-butanol (-115 ℃)

>> ○ Unlike boiling points, melting points are influenced not only by intermolecular forces but also by packing, so the melting point of 2-methyl-2-propanol (25 ℃) is quite high.

⑵ Boiling points of alcohols

> ① Higher number of carbons leads to stronger intermolecular forces and higher boiling points.

>> ○ Example: methanol (65 ℃) < ethanol (78 ℃) < propan-1-ol (97 ℃)

> ② Much higher boiling points than alkenes, alkynes, and alkyl halides due to hydrogen bond.

> ③ 1,3-diols have higher boiling points than 1,2-diols.

>> ○ Reason: 1,2-diols with well-formed intramolecular hydrogen bonding have weaker intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

⑶ Acidity of alcohols

> ① Acidity in solution: methyl > 1<sup>st</sup> > 2<sup>nd</sup> > 3<sup>rd</sup>

>> ○ Key Memorization: [pK<sub>a</sub>](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1352)

>>> ○ Methanol (MeOH): 15.5

>>> ○ Ethanol (EtOH): 16

>>> ○ i-PrOH: 16.5

>>> ○ t-BuOH: 18

>> ○ [Solvation effect](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359#5-solvents)

>>> ○ Alcohols with more alkyl groups have weaker solvation effects due to hydrogen bonding.

>>> ○ As a result, alkoxide ions, which are the conjugate bases, are less stabilized, leading to lower acidity.

>> ○ Inductive effect

>>> ○ Inductive effects explain acidity in solution, but not in the gas phase.

> ② Acidity of alcohols in the gas phase: methyl < 1<sup>st</sup> < 2<sup>nd</sup> < 3<sup>rd</sup>

>> ○ No solvation effect in the gas phase.

>> ○ The alkyl groups disperse negative charges in thiol compounds more effectively, resulting in higher acidity of thiols compared to alcohols due to the polarizability or size effect.

⑷ Strength of hydrogen bonding in alcohols

> ① Strength of hydrogen bonding: 1<sup>st/sup> > 2<sup>nd</sup> > 3<sup>rd</sup>

> ② Steric hindrance: 1<sup>st</sup> < 2<sup>nd</sup> < 3<sup>rd</sup>

<br>

<br>

## **3. Reactions**

⑴ Overview

> ① Central aspect of reactions: Since OH<sup>-</sup> is a strong base and a poor leaving group, processes that transform it into a good leaving group occur.

> ② **Type 1:** Dehydration reaction **(Important to memorize)**: S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions involve 1st or secondary alcohols. Non-S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions involve 2<sup>nd</sup> or tertiary alcohols.

>> ○ SOCl<sub>2</sub> group: S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction

>> ○ HCl group: S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction

>> ○ POCl<sub>3</sub> (catalyst: pyridine) group: E2 reaction

>> ○ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> group: E1 reaction

> ③ **Type 2:** Alcohol protection and deprotection reactions

> ④ **Type 3:** Acid-base reactions

> ⑤ **Type 4:** Oxidation reactions

> ⑥ **Type 5:** Other reactions: Ether synthesis, ester synthesis, pinacol rearrangement reaction

⑵ **1-1.** [S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1361) 

> ① Reagents: SOCl<sub>2</sub>, PBr<sub>3</sub>, PCl<sub>3</sub>, PCl<sub>5</sub> + 1<sup>st</sup> or secondary alcohols

>> ○ **primary alcohols, secondary alcohols:** Since X<sup>-</sup> is a weak base, S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction occurs rather than E2.

>>> ○ secondary alcohols < primary alcohols

>> ○ tertiary alcohols: S<sub>N</sub>1/E1 reactions are very slow, so the reaction is considered not to occur.

>> ○ Reaction of alcohols with SOCl<sub>2</sub> depending on the solvent

>>> ○ Pyridine solvent: Frontside inversion

>>> ○ Ether solvent: Retention of configuration

>>> ○ **Hypothesis 1:** If ether acts as a nucleophile, two S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions occur, explaining the mechanism.

>>> ○ **Hypothesis 2:** S<sub>N</sub>i (SN internal): Explains that retention occurs due to intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.

> ② SOCl<sub>2</sub> mechanism

>> ○ Converts alcohols into good leaving groups

⑶ **1-2.** [S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1361) 

> ① Reagents: HCl, HBr, HI + secondary or tertiary alcohols

>> ○ HCl reaction is relatively weak, so it is catalyzed by compounds like ZnCl<sub>2</sub>.

>>> ○ HF ≪ HCl < HBr < HI

>> ○ **primary alcohols:** S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction; Attack of nucleophile occurs without waiting for -OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> to leave, since X<sup>-/sup> is a weak base.

>> ○ **secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols:** S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction; HX is a strong acid, readily generating the excellent leaving group -OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>.

> ② Mechanism

<br>

**Figure 6.** S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction of alcohols in the presence of HX

<br>

> ③ Carbocation: racemization, rearrangement

> ④ Lucas test: Distinguishes between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols using HCl and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>.

>> ○ The solution where a reaction occurs becomes turbid.

>> ○ Reaction equation: ROH + HCl → RCl (catalyst: anhydrous ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, conditions: room temperature)

>> ○ Primary alcohol: No reaction (S<sub>N</sub>2)

>> ○ Secondary alcohol: Reaction after about 5 minutes (S<sub>N</sub>2 and S<sub>N</sub>1)

> ④ **Carbon cation:** **Migration reaction, racemization**

> ⑤ When both alkene and -OH group are present in a single molecule, alkene reacts first ( **∵** increased reactivity of alkene)

>> ○ To add, the acid-base reaction of the -OH group occurs most rapidly, but the reverse reaction can occur, forming a minor product.

> ⑥ Primary alcohols undergo E2 mechanism under the same conditions ( **∵** due to the unstable nature of primary carbocation)

>>> ○ **Retention of configuration:** Alcohol attacks, no change in self-positioning

>>> ○ Note the distinction between retection of configuration and absolute configuration (R, S) preservation

>>> ○ Stable at pH 4 ~ 12

>>> ○ Imidazole or pyridine generate alkoxide ion, removing byproduct HCl

>> ○ Oxidation reaction of cyclohexyl alcohol: Using H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> as the reference,

>>> ○ When -OH group is in the axial direction, the oxidation reaction is faster.

>>> ○ **Reason 1:** It is easier for the base to approach to remove the hydrogen in the equatorial position.

>>> ○ **Reason 2:** When chromic acid ester is oriented axially, the reactant becomes more unstable, resulting in lower activation energy for activation.

>> ○ Summary: Elimination reaction is dominant at high temperatures, while addition reaction is dominant at low temperatures.

>> ○ (_not desirable_) H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 180℃: R-CH<sub>2</sub>OH + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → R=CH<sub>2</sub>. [E1 Elimination of alcohols](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1372)

>> ○ (_desirable_) H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 140℃: R-CH<sub>2</sub>OH + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → R-CH<sub>2</sub>-O-CH<sub>2</sub>-R

>> ○ Drawback: Symmetric ether synthesis results in various ethers (i.e., ROR, R'OR, R'OR'), making it inappropriate.

>> ○ As an exception, when a tertiary alcohol is used as one component, successful synthesis of unsymmetric ethers can be achieved ( **∵** S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction)

⑷ Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

> ① NaBH<sub>4</sub>: Mild reducing agent

>> ○ Cannot reduce carboxylic acids to alcohols

>> ○ Reduces aldehydes to primary alcohols

>> ○ Reduces ketones to secondary alcohols

>> ○ Prolonged reaction can reduce alcohols to H

> ② LiAlH<sub>4</sub>: Strong reducing agent

>> ○ Reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols

>> ○ Reduces ketones to secondary alcohols

>> ○ Prolonged reaction can reduce alcohols to H

>> ○ LiAlH<sub>4</sub> used as a reagent is much stronger than NaBH<sub>4</sub> as a reducing agent

> ③ **(Formula)** NaBH<sub>4</sub> and LiAlH<sub>4</sub> are considered sources of H<sup>-</sup> for reduction

**Figure 21.** Example of alcohol reduction using LiAlH<sub>4</sub>

<br>

>> ○ H<sub>2</sub>O can replace H<sup>+</sup> as a proton source

>> ○ Carboxylic acid interpretation: -COOH temporarily becomes -C<sup>+</sup>O<sup>-</sup>OH, and when H<sup>-</sup> attaches to C<sup>+</sup>, it becomes -CHO<sup>-</sup>OH, which then becomes -CHO.

>> ○ Aldehyde interpretation: -CHO temporarily becomes -C<sup>+</sup>O<sup>-</sup>OH, and when H<sup>-</sup> attaches to C<sup>+</sup>, it becomes -CH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>-</sup>.

>> ○ Ketone interpretation: -CO<sup>-</sup> temporarily becomes -C<sup>+</sup>O<sup>-</sup>-, and when H<sup>-</sup> attaches to C<sup>+</sup>, it becomes -CHO<sup>-</sup>-.

>> ○ Alcohol: Alcohols can also be reduced; -COH becomes -C<sup>+</sup>, and when H<sup>-</sup> attaches to C<sup>+</sup>, it becomes -CH.

⑸ Carbon-Carbon Coupling Reactions ([Organic Reactions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1401))

> ① Grignard reagent: RMgX

>> ○ **(Formula)** RMgX: Mg becomes δ<sup>+</sup> and R has a strong negative charge, seeking electrophilic carbons; start connecting from R.
