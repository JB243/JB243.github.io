## **3\. Second Law of Thermodynamics**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Entropy **:** A state function that represents disorder.

> ② Reversible process **:** A process with a total entropy change of 0.

> ③ The second law of thermodynamics can be expressed in four different ways.

 ⑵ **Expression 1**

> ① Spontaneous change **:** Change that occurs without external influence.

> ② Law **:** Spontaneous changes occur in the direction of increasing the universe's entropy.

> ③ Surroundings' entropy ΔS_surroundings **:** Independent of whether the reaction is reversible or irreversible.

>> ○ The application of the second law of thermodynamics is possible only when an isolated system is formed by the system of interest and its surroundings.

>> ○ Calculation of ΔS_surroundings **:** Independent of reversible **·** irreversible reactions. Assumes constant temperature and pressure in the surroundings.

>> ○ Although ΔS_surroundings is not as simple as described above, it is important to note that it is composed of values derivable from the system.

> ④ Conclusion **:** If ΔS_total > 0, spontaneous; if ΔS_total < 0, non-spontaneous.

 ⑶ **Expression 2: Clausius Inequality**

> ① Clausius's expression **:** Heat flows from hot to cold. It cannot spontaneously flow from cold to hot.

> ② Formulation (with equality condition for reversible processes)

> ③ Proof

>> ○ To do work on the system, the external pressure must be increased along with the rise in external pressure.

>> ○ Therefore, the reversible condition does more work on the surroundings than the irreversible condition.

>> ○ If the initial and final states of reversible and irreversible processes are the same (applying physical representation),

>> ○ Hence, the following equation is obtained.

> ④ Derivation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics **:** If the system is isolated from the surroundings, dq = 0, so dS ≥ 0.

> ⑤ Free Expansion

>> ○ Free expansion and isothermal expansion have the same entropy change intuitively.

>> ○ In free expansion, there is no heat exchange.

>> ○ In free expansion, since it's not a reversible process, the above formula cannot be applied.

 ⑷ **Expression 3: Carnot Engine**

> ① Kelvin-Planck's expression **:** It's impossible to create a heat engine that converts all absorbed heat into work.

> ② In other words, an engine with 100% efficiency cannot be created.

> ③ Carnot engine efficiency is 70% **:** With 100 units of heat, only 70 units can be converted into work.

 ⑸ **Expression 4: Statistical Mechanical Definition**

> ① Defined by Boltzmann's equation, also known as Boltzmann entropy.

> ② State number W **:** Number of ways the molecules of the system can be arranged while keeping the total energy constant.

>> ○ Positional probability **:** The greater the disorder of molecular arrangement, the more cases there are in that direction for the reaction to proceed.

>> ○ Molecular motion states **:** More cases for molecular arrangement occur at different energy levels, preferred at higher temperatures → Entropy increases with higher temperatures.

>> ○ Absolute value of entropy and definition of entropy at 0 can be defined → Third Law of Thermodynamics.

> ③ Equivalence of Thermodynamic and Statistical Mechanical Definitions

>> ○ Assume that the microscopic state number given to a single molecule is proportional to its volume.

>> ○ For N molecules, the total state number is represented as follows

>> ○ The statistical entropy during isothermal expansion of an ideal gas is as follows

>> ○ Ultimately, the definition of statistical entropy is equivalent to the definition of thermodynamic entropy.

>> ○ It's conjectured that Boltzmann performed reverse calculations to extract profound meaning from thermodynamic definition.

> ④ Classical Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Statistical Mechanics

>> ○ Classical Statistical Mechanics **:** Initiated by Boltzmann's thermodynamic concepts.

>> ○ Quantum Statistical Mechanics **:** Characterized by quantum mechanical concepts such as orbital theory.

 ⑹ Application of Entropy

> ① **Application 1:** [General Thermodynamic Process](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1345)

> ② **Application 2:** Predicting Entropy Change in Gas Reactions

>> ○ Reaction entropy ΔS **:** In reactions where the number of gas molecules increases, ΔS > 0.

> ③ **Application 3:** Expansion in Vacuum

>> ○ ΔT = 0, W = 0 → Q = 0

>> ○ Thermodynamic definition doesn't apply in this situation.

>> ○ Approaching the problem with the concept of state number from statistical mechanics is similar to isothermal expansion.

> ④ **Application 4:** Entropy of Phase Transition

>> ○ Under constant pressure, phase transition temperature T_transition is constant, and Q_p = ΔH.

>> ○ Standard molar entropy of phase transition ΔS° **:** Entropy change during transition at standard conditions (1 bar).

>> ○ Trouton's rule **:** Most liquids have a standard vaporization entropy of about 85 J/K.

>>> ○ Water has a relatively large ΔS°vap (**∵** liquid water has low entropy).

**Table. 2.** Standard Vaporization Entropy of Liquids at Normal Boiling Points

> ⑤ **Application 5:** The reason time flows in one direction is related to the second law of thermodynamics.

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Third Law of Thermodynamics**

 ⑴ Nernst's Heat Theorem

> ① **Expression 1:** Entropy change associated with physical or chemical changes approaches 0 as temperature approaches absolute zero.

> ② **Expression 2:** The entropy of all perfect crystalline substances is 0 at T = 0.

 ⑵ Residual Entropy

> ① The entropy actually measured at T = 0.

> ② **Example 1:** Residual entropy of CO **:** Random orientation allows relatively free motion, increasing residual entropy.

>> ○ Considering two CO molecules, CO ··· CO and CO ··· OC are two possible arrangements. According to Boltzmann's statistical definition, the absolute entropy is k ln (2×2) = k ln 4. When expanded to 1 mole (6.02 × 10^23 molecules), the predicted residual entropy is S = NAk ln 2 = 5.76 J/K. The actual measured value is 4.6 J/K, which is quite similar.

> ③ **Example 2:** Residual entropy of HCl **:** Only one type of arrangement is possible, making the residual entropy close to 0.

 ⑶ Standard Molar Entropy

> ① Absolute zero **:** Defines the entropy of a pure solid crystal as 0 at 0 K.

> ② Calculation of standard molar entropy of substances

> ③ **Characteristic 1:** Sm(s) < Sm(ℓ) < Sm(g) **:** Entropy becomes more disordered as it goes from solid to gas.

> ④ **Characteristic 2:** Molar entropy of heavy elements is higher than that of light elements.

> ⑤ **Characteristic 3:** Larger and more complex chemical species have higher molar entropy than smaller and simpler ones.

> ⑥ Standard Molar Entropy at 25°C

**Table. 3.** Standard Molar Entropy of Substances at 25°C (J/K · mol)

 ⑷ Standard Reaction Entropy

<br>

## **5\. Gibbs Free Energy** (G)

 ⑴ Definition **:** A state function that indicates the spontaneity of a reaction.

> ① Applying the second law of thermodynamics requires considering both the system and the surroundings, which is cumbersome.

> ② Gibbs free energy requires only the properties of the system to judge the spontaneity of the reaction, making it easier.

>> ○ (Note) If properties of the system and surroundings are considered separately, the calculation process becomes more complicated.

> ③ **Meaning 1:** ΔG < 0 indicates a spontaneous reaction, ΔG > 0 indicates a non-spontaneous reaction, ΔG = 0 indicates equilibrium.

> ④ **Meaning 2:** For a **constant temperature and pressure**, the maximum reversible work obtainable from a reaction.

> ⑤ Limitation **:** The change in the surroundings' entropy is not that simple.

 ⑵ Proof

> Since at constant temperature and pressure, dq = dH and dq_surroundings = -dH, the equation changes as follows.

> Multiplying both sides by -T yields the Gibbs free energy equation.

> Since spontaneous reactions have dS_total > 0,

 ⑶ Physical Interpretation **:** ΔG = Maximum non-expansion work

> ① Electrochemistry and Gibbs Free Energy (where E = reduction potential)

 ⑷ Relationship between ΔG and Reaction Rate

> ① Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) Principle **:** Gibbs free activation energy is proportional to reaction Gibbs free energy.

> ② This principle, like Hammond's Postulate, seems to be an empirical rule.
