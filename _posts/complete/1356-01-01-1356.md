## **2. [Nomenclature](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357)**

⑴ IUPAC Systematic Naming

> ① Prefix - Locant - Parent - Suffix

> ② Prefix: Indicates the type and number of substituents and their positions on the parent chain

> ③ Locant: Designates the position of the main functional group

> ④ Parent: Indicates the number of carbon atoms in the parent chain

> ⑤ Suffix: Indicates the functional group present in the compound, such as alkane, alkene, alkyne

⑵ Straight-Chain Alkane Nomenclature

> ① Selecting the main chain

>> ○ Choose the longest continuous carbon chain as the main chain and treat the rest as substituents (side chains)

>> ○ If there are multiple chains of the same length, choose the one with the most substituents as the main chain

> ② Substituent naming

>> ○ Here, assume that only alkyl groups and halogen groups are present in the substituents.

>> ○ Alkyl group: If alkane or cycloalkane acts as a substituent, replace -ane with -yl

>>> ○ Alkyl groups can be represented as R groups

>>> ○ Some R groups are represented with abbreviations (e.g., me for methyl, et for ethyl, pro for propyl)

>>> ○ alkyl (e.g., ethyl), alkenyl (e.g., ethenyl), and alkynyl (e.g., ethynyl) have equal priority

>>> ○ Common names: isopropyl, isobutyl, _sec_-butyl, _tert_-butyl, isopentyl, neopentyl

>> ○ Halogen groups: If a halogen element is a substituent, replace it with -o

>>> ○ Examples: fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo

>> ○ If the same substituent appears more than once, use prefixes to indicate their number

>>> ○ Examples: di(2), tri(3), tetra(4), penta(5), hexa(6)

> ③ Numbering

>> ○ Assign sequential numbers to carbons along the main chain from one end to the other

>> ○ When there is only one substituent, give the lowest number to the carbon bearing the substituent

>> ○ When multiple substituents are present, assign numbering such that the lowest number is given to a certain substituent. Even if the sum of the numbers increases significantly, it remains a valid nomenclature.

>>> ○ Example: 2,6,6-trimethyloctane (O)

>>> ○ Example: 3,3,7-trimethyloctane (X)

>> ○ If numbers are the same, prioritize alphabetical order for the substituents

>>> ○ Example: 3-ethyl-5-methylheptane

> ④ Complete Naming

>> ○ List the substituents in alphabetical order

>>> ○ Examples: 4-ethyl-3-methyloctane

>>> ○ Prefixes like di(2), tri(3), etc., aren't included in the alphabetical order

>>>> ○ Example: 4-ethyl-2,3-dimethylheptane (O)

>>>> ○ Example: 2,3-dimethyl-4-ethylheptane (X)

>>>> ○ Exception: Exceptionally, if a substituent has another substituent, include it in the alphabetical order.

>>>>> ○ Example: 7-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)-4-ethyldodecane

>>> ○ Consider prefixes like iso, neo, cyclo for alphabetical order if using common names for substituents

>>>> ○ Example: isopropyl > methyl

>>> ○ Ignore hyphenated prefixes like sec-, tert- when determining alphabetical order

>>>> ○ Example: sec-butyl > ethyl

>> ○ Named as 《(substituent position-substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + main chain + suffix》.

>>> ○ However, for alkanes, the suffix is -ane.

> ⑤ For complex substituents, consider them as a single substituent. Enclose the substituent name in parentheses and prioritize alphabetical order

>> ○ The carbon in the substituent attached to the main chain is labeled as carbon 1.

>> ○ Examples: 4-(2-methylhexyl)octane

>> ○ Examples: 7-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)-4-ethyldecane

⑶ Nomenclature of Cyclic Alkanes

> ① When only cyclic alkanes are present

>> ○ Prefix "cyclo" is added to the name of the alkane that corresponds to the number of carbons in the ring

>> ○ Examples: cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane

> ② Naming the main chain

>> ○ According to the previous IUPAC guidelines

>>> ○ **Case 1:** When both acyclic and cyclic alkane structures coexist: Represent the cyclic alkane as a substituent in the following cases:

>>>> ○ When the substituent has a larger number of carbons

>>>> ○ When multiple rings are present

>>>> ○ When neither can be chosen as the parent structure

>>> ○ **Case 2:** When the number of carbons in the acyclic alkane chain and the cyclic alkane are the same, consider the cyclic alkane as the parent structure.

>> ○ [Latest IUPAC Guidelines](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/19229/is-the-ring-or-the-chain-chosen-as-the-parent-structure-in-octan-2-ylbenzene): In cases where both ring and chain structures are present, the ring is chosen as the parent structure.

>>> ○ Example: octylcyclobutane (preferred)
 
> ③ When a cyclic alkane is the main chain

>> ○ If there is only one substituent, numbering is not required

>>> ○ Example: methylcyclohexane

>> ○ When multiple numbering methods are possible, assign numbers so that at least one is the smallest possible number (ref).

>>> ○ Example: 1-chloro-2,2,3-trimethylcyclopropane (X), 2-chloro-1,1,3-trimethylcyclopropane (O)

>> ○ When there are two or more substituents, name the substituents, number the positions, and then name the entire molecule.

>>> ○ The carbon attached to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order is numbered 1.

>>> ○ Example: 1-ethyl-2-methylcyclopentane

> ④ When an acyclic alkane is the main chain: Include the ring position number

>> ○ Example: 1-cyclobutylpentane

⑷ Nomenclature of Complex Cyclic Alkanes

> ① Bicyclic alkanes or bridged rings

>> ○ Investigate the path from one bridgehead carbon to another.

>> ○ Count the number of carbons excluding the bridgehead carbon in each path and write it as [x.y.z] in decreasing order.

>> ○ Numbering:

>>> ○ **Step 1.** Number each carbon starting from one at each bridgehead, following the longest path.

>>> ○ **Step 2.** Number the largest ring first.

**Figure 2.** Nomenclature of Bicyclic Alkanes

<br>

>> ○ Naming format: 《(substituent position + substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + bicyclo[x.y.z]alkane》, where alkane indicates the total number of carbons.

> ③ Spiro rings (spiro ring)

>> ○ Investigate the path from one bridgehead carbon to itself

>> ○ Count the number of carbon atoms excluding the bridgehead carbon in each path and write it in ascending order as [x.z].

>> ○ Different from bicycloalkanes and fused rings due to not having a bridgehead carbon at 1.

>> ○ Numbering: Proceed as in ①

>> ○ Format: 《(_substituent position + substituent name_)<sub>n</sub> + _bicyclo[x.z]alkane_》, where "alkane" indicates the total number of carbons

>>> ○ Example: 1-bromo-3-chlorospiro[4.5]decan-7-ol

## **3. Degree of Unsaturation** (I.H.D., index of hydrogen deficiency)

⑴ I.H.D. (index of hydrogen deficiency): Used to predict structures with multiple bonds or ring structures

⑵ Basic formula

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/4aeb50d9-c900-4e72-a099-647e5260f5ac)

<br>

⑶ Additional rules

> ① Halogen elements: Consider as hydrogen for analysis

> ② Oxygen: Disregard for analysis

> ③ Nitrogen: Subtract one hydrogen per nitrogen for analysis

⑷ **Tip:** The degree of unsaturation for a ring is equal to the minimum number of bonds that need to be broken until the ring is absent

> ① The reason the degree of unsaturation for adamantane is 3 can be understood using this tip

<br>

<br>

## **4. Physical Properties of Alkanes**

⑴ Boiling Point

> ① Alkanes have lower boiling points than similarly sized polar molecules

> ② Increase in carbon number → Increase in surface area → Increase in intermolecular forces → Increase in boiling point

> ③ As surface area increases, boiling point increases: Alkanes without branches have higher boiling points among alkanes with similar molecular weights

>> ○ Example: neopentane (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>C (9.5 ℃) < isopentane (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> (27.8 ℃)

⑵ Melting Point (Freezing Point)

> ① Alkanes have lower melting points than similarly sized polar molecules

> ② Increase in carbon number → Increase in surface area → Increase in intermolecular forces → Increase in melting point

> ③ Symmetry: Increased symmetry leads to higher melting points for isomers

>> ○ Example: neopentane (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>C (-16.5 ℃) > 2,2-dimethylbutane (-98 ℃) > isopentane (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> (-160 ℃)

>> ○ Reverse order compared to boiling point

> ④ Alkanes with an even number of carbons form more regular crystalline lattice structures than those with an odd number, resulting in higher melting points.

>> ○ 2n → 2n + 1: The increase in melting point is small.

>> ○ 2n + 1 → 2n + 2: The increase in melting point is large.

>> ○ Even ethane has a higher melting point than propane.

⑶ Solubility

> ① Alkanes dissolve in organic solvents

> ② Alkanes are insoluble in water

<br>

<br>

## 5. Conformational Isomers (Conformers)

⑴ Overview

> ① Conformational isomers: Exhibiting various conformations due to free rotation of single bonds

> ② Conformational isomers are not strict isomers.

> ③ Cyclic alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes cannot freely rotate.

> ④ Newman projection: A model introduced for analyzing conformational isomers

>> ○ The central dot represents the front carbon, the circle represents the back carbon

⑵ Torsional Strain: Energy difference due to the eclipsed conformation in conformational isomers

> ① Ethane: Eclipsed conformation is about 12 kJ/mol higher in energy compared to staggered conformation

>> ○ Energy analysis

>>> ○ H-H staggered: 0 kJ/mol (reference)

>>> ○ H-H eclipsed: About 4 kJ/mol (1 kcal/mol) (torsional strain)

<br>

**Figure. 3.** Newman Projection of Ethane

<br>

>> ○ Stability of staggered conformation

>>> ○ **Reason 1:** Minimum electron-electron repulsion

>>> ○ **Reason 2:** Electrons in bonding (σ) MOs stabilize by interacting with antibonding (σ*) MOs

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/5c3928f3-a807-4f90-acee-55560046a15e)

**Figure. 4.** Staggered Conformation Stability in Ethane 

<br>

> ② Propane: Eclipsed conformation is about 14 kJ/mol higher in energy compared to staggered conformation

>> ○ Energy analysis

>>> ○ H-H staggered: 0 kJ/mol (reference)

>>> ○ H-H eclipsed: About 4 kJ/mol (1 kcal/mol) (torsional strain)

>>> ○ CH<sub>3</sub>-H eclipsed: About 6 kJ/mol (torsional strain)

>> ○ Eclipsed conformation introduces greater torsional strain due to steric hindrance from the bulky methyl group overlapping with hydrogen

> ③ Butane: Differentiated as anti-staggered (most stable), gauche staggered, eclipsed, etc.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/de053ae0-f855-4518-baf0-e0badc76b1dc)

**Figure 5.** Newman Projection of Butane 

<br>

>> ○ Newman projections for C1-C2, C3-C4 are possible, but C2-C3 provides a more detailed energy profile.

>> ○ Energy analysis

>>> ○ H-H staggered: 0 kJ/mol (reference)

>>> ○ H-H eclipsed: About 4 kJ/mol (1 kcal/mol) (torsional strain)

>>> ○ CH<sub>3</sub>-H eclipsed: About 6 kJ/mol (torsional strain)

>>> ○ CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> fully eclipsed: About 13 kJ/mol (4 kcal/mol) (torsional strain + steric interaction)

>>> ○ H-CH<sub>3</sub> gauche: 0 kJ/mol

>>> ○ CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> gauche: About 3.8 kJ/mol (0.9 kcal/mol) (steric interaction)

>> ○ Instability in _gauche_

>>> ○ Slightly more unstable due to closer proximity of methyl groups compared to anti-staggered

>>> ○ This repulsion is called van der Waals strain or steric strain

>> ○ Stability in _anti_

>>> ○ **Reason 1:** Minimum electron-electron repulsion

>>> ○ **Reason 2:** Electrons of methyl group stabilize by interacting with antibonding orbitals (σ*)

> ④ Rotation Barrier Energy: Energy difference between the highest and lowest energy conformations

>> ○ Generally within the range of natural energy fluctuations

⑶ Ring Strain

> ① Ring Strain = Torsional Strain + Angle Strain + Steric Strain (van der Waals strain)

>> ○ Steric hindrance (torsional strain): Structural instability due to van der Waals repulsion within a molecule

>> ○ Angle strain: Difficult to achieve the ideal 109.5° bond angle in sp3 hybrids for cyclic compounds

>>> ○ Formation of sigma bonds in a non-linear fashion to achieve the ideal angle → instability

> ② Experimental Values for Ring Strain

>> ○ cyclopropane ≫ cyclobutane > cyclopentane ≒ cycloheptane > cyclohexane

<br>

>> ○ Actual cyclobutane has a bent structure, resembling a butterfly shape.

>> ○ The flip energy barrier of cyclobutane is about 1.4 kcal/mol, resulting in rapid ring flipping.

> ⑤ Cyclopentane

>> ○ Adopts an envelope or half-chair conformation to reduce torsional strain.

>> ○ Cyclopentane is considered a stable ring structure due to similar ring strain to cyclohexane.

>> ○ Reason for the prevalence of 5- or 6-membered ring compounds in organic reactions.

> ⑥ Cyclohexane

>> ○ No ring strain in cyclohexane → highly stable similar to hexane

>> ○ Reason for the prevalence of 5- or 6-membered ring compounds in organic reactions

>> ○ Reason: All bond angles in cyclohexane's chair conformation are around 111°, matching the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization condition's ideal angle

>> ○ Chair, half-chair, twist boat, boat conformations exist: Energy sequence is chair < twist boat < boat < half-chair

**Figure 14.** Process of calculating ΔG(C)

<br>

>>> ○ Because equatorial orientation of tert-butyl group is complex, deduction is made from trans-decalin form.

>>> ○ The cyclohexane in Figure C corresponds to the left cyclohexane in the figure above.

>>> ○ The red, blue, and green lines on the right all represent methyl groups: tert-butyl group in Figure C.

>>> ○ The red line <span style="color: red;">■</span> reflects H-CH<sub>3</sub> 1,3-diaxial interaction **(2 × 0.9)**

>>> ○ The blue line <span style="color: blue;">■</span> reflects H-CH<sub>3</sub> 1,3-diaxial interaction **(0.9)**

>>> ○ The green line <span style="color: green;">■</span> reflects H-CH<sub>3</sub> 1,3-diaxial interaction **(0.9)**

>> ○ ΔG(D) = base + 2 × 3.6 + 4 × 0.9 (kcal/mol)

**Figure 15.** Process of calculating ΔG(D)

<br>

>>> ○ Because axial orientation of tert-butyl group is more complex, deduction is made from cis-decalin form

>>> ○ The cyclohexane in Figure D corresponds to the right cyclohexane in the figure above

>>> ○ The red <span style="color: red;">■</span>, blue <span style="color: blue;">■</span>, and green lines <span style="color: green;">■</span> at the bottom all represent methyl groups: tert-butyl group in Figure D

>>> ○ The red line <span style="color: red;">■</span> reflects CH3-CH3 1,3-diaxial interaction **(2 × 3.6)**

>>> ○ The blue line <span style="color: blue;">■</span> reflects H-CH3 1,3-diaxial interaction **(0.9)**

>>> ○ The green line <span style="color: green;">■</span> reflects H-CH3 1,3-diaxial interaction **(0.9)**

>> ○ ΔG = ΔG(D) - ΔG(C) = (2 × 3.6) - (2 × 0.9) = 5.4 kcal/mol

> ⑦ **Application 5.** _trans_-1,3-di-_tert_-butyl cyclohexane

>> ○ When _tert_-butyl group is axial, energy instability increases, leading to a twist boat conformation

>> ○ In this case, although ring strain increases, instability due to 1,3-diaxial interaction decreases significantly, resulting in overall stability

**Figure 16.** Stereoscopic structure of tetrahydropyran-3-methanol

<br>

>> ○ In cases where a single substituent is in the axial position, it is generally unstable

>> ○ However, in this case, the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding makes the axial position more stable

> ⑨ **Application 7.** Substituent-specific 1,3-diaxial interaction: The proportion equation that follows represents equatorial-axial ratio

>> ○ -CN: 0.4 kJ/mol

>> ○ -F: 0.5 kJ/mol

>> ○ -C≡N: 0.2 kcal/mol

>> ○ -NO<sub>2</sub>: 1.2 kcal/mol

> ⑪ **Application 9.** Substituent interaction with more than one group (general rule)

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Place the substituent with the largest 1,3-diaxial interaction horizontally

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Consider cis and trans based on that carbon, draw the remaining substituents

>> ○ Example: 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane is very stable in the _cis_ form due to equatorial arrangement, making _cis_ reaction dominant

**Figure 17.** Anomeric Effect

<br>

>> ○ Definition: The phenomenon where a substituent next to a heteroatom in a cyclohexane prefers an _axial_ orientation

>> ○ Epimer: Stereoisomers with multiple chiral centers differing in the stereostructure of only one

>> ○ Anomer: Absolute arrangement difference of acetal or hemiacetal carbons in an epimer

>> ○ **Case 1:** No heteroatom in cyclohexane: Substituent prefers _equatorial_ orientation

>> ○ **Case 2:** Substituent next to heteroatom -OH: _axial_ orientation: _equatorial_ orientation = 1: 2

>> ○ **Case 3:** Substituent next to heteroatom -methoxy, -Cl, -acetyl: Prefers _axial_ orientation

>> ○ Difference between **Case 2** and **Case 3** corresponds to the difference between glucose and most glucose derivatives

>> ○ Various mechanisms have been proposed for the specific mechanism

## **7. Alkane Reactions**

> ⑴ Low reactivity

> ① All single bonds, non-polar → No acid-base reactions, no redox reactions

> ② Due to low reactivity, primarily used as organic solvents

> ③ Called paraffins due to low reactivity

> ⑵ **Reaction 1.** Combustion reaction

> ① Exothermic reaction

> ② Complete combustion: Products are water and carbon dioxide

> ③ Incomplete combustion: Products are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acetic acid

> ⑶ **Reaction 2.** Catalytic cracking

> ① Definition: Reaction where alkanes are heated, leading to bond cleavage or formation of multiple bonds

> ② Advantages: Economical method to synthesize large quantities of alkenes

> ③ Disadvantages: Not a great method as it forms various mixtures

> ⑷ **Reaction 3.** Reforming

> ① Straight chain alkanes transform into branched alkanes or aromatic compounds through reforming process

> ② Through cracking and reforming, gasoline yield becomes 47%: Natural gasoline ratio in petroleum is only 19%
