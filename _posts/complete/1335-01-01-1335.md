## **1\. Band Gap Theory**

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Theory analyzing potential energy for confined atoms, not free particles

> ② Explains semiconductors

 ⑵ Fermi-Dirac Statistics

> ① Fermi-Dirac Distribution

>> ○ Definition: Probability of energy level E being occupied by particles at arbitrary temperature T

>> ○ Electrons in atomic lattice structure follow Fermi-Dirac distribution

> ② Fermi Level

>> ○ Definition: Highest energy level electrons can occupy at 0 K

>> ○ Fermi level defined in this way leads to electrons having a 50% probability of occupancy at any temperature

>> ○ Electrons exceeding certain energy beyond Fermi level become free electrons, ignoring atomic nucleus potential

> ③ Fermi Gas

>> ○ Fermi Gas (Free Electron Gas): Ensemble of non-interacting fermions

>> ○ According to Pauli Exclusion Principle, average energy of Fermi gas at absolute zero is greater than that of ground-state single particle

>> ○ Degeneracy pressure: At absolute zero, Fermi gas pressure is nonzero due to Pauli Exclusion Principle

## **2\. Bloch's Theorem**

 ⑴ Definition: Potential energy U(x) is periodic and U(x+a) = U(x)

 ⑵ Formulation

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Kronig-Penney Model**

 ⑴ Definition

**Figure. 1.** Kronig-Penney Model

 ⑵ Assumptions

> ① Assumes crystal is infinite

> ② Assumes crystal structure has step-like potential

 ⑶ Formulation

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Energy Bands and Brillouin Zone**

 ⑴ **Interpretation 1:** Mathematical Interpretation

> ① Potential energy f(ξ) oscillates

> ② cos k(a+b) takes values between -1 and 1

> ③ As ξ increases, existence of solutions → existence of solutions → non-existence of solutions → ···

> ④ Conclusion: Energy levels manifest as bands

 ⑵ **Interpretation 2:** Pauli Exclusion Principle

> ① Pauli Exclusion Principle: No more than one electron with the same quantum numbers can exist in a single orbital

> ② Many atoms together cause energy levels to overlap and shift slightly, forming energy bands

**Figure. 2.** Splitting of Energy Levels Due to Orbital Overlap [Footnote:1]

**Figure. 3.** Formation of Energy Bands Due to Orbital Overlap [Footnote:2]

 ⑶ **Interpretation 3:** Coulomb's Law

> ① Electrons repel each other, causing slight splitting of energy levels

> ② Many atoms together cause energy levels to shift slightly, forming energy bands

 ⑷ Classification of Energy Bands

> ① **Energy Band:** Continuous range where states exist

> ② **Forbidden Band Gap:** Continuous range without states (except for the initial range)

> ③ **Band Gap:** Energy required to transition electrons from valence band to conduction band

> ④ Energy bands further categorized into valence band and conduction band

> ⑤ (Note) Valence and Conduction Bands of a Single Atom

>> ○ Magnesium atom's valence band includes 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s orbitals

>> ○ Magnesium atom's conduction band includes 3p, 4s, 3d orbitals beyond 3s

## **5\. E-k Diagram**

**Figure. 4.** E-k Diagram 

 ⑴ k ∈ [-π / (a + b), π / (a + b)]

 ⑵ k = 0, ± π / (a + b): Slope of E-k diagram is 0 **:** Observed not only in Kronig-Penney model but also in reality

 ⑶ E-k solutions outside the range selected by periodicity overlap with solutions within the selected range

 ⑷ Only two k values possible per allowed energy (due to symmetry at the origin)

 ⑸ When expanding the E-k diagram, it resembles a parabola and converges as energy increases

**Figure. 5.** Expanded E-k Diagram 

 ⑹ (Note) Real E-k diagram is complex, but generally parabolic at ends of bands

 ⑺ (Note) Free particles also have a parabolic E-k diagram (since E ∝ p2, p ∝ k)

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Meaning of k**

 ⑴ For free particles, k = wave vector, hk = momentum

 ⑵ For periodic potential, k = wave vector, hk = crystal momentum

 ⑶ Represents a constant related to interactions and momentum within the crystal, not actual electron momentum

<br>

<br>

## **7\. Introduction to Effective Mass Concept**

 ⑴ [Effective Mass](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1329)

 ⑵ Near the bottom of all bands in E-k diagram, the curvature is downward **:** meff > 0 (electrons)

 ⑶ Near the top of all bands in E-k diagram, the curvature is upward **:** meff < 0 (holes)

 ⑷ End parts of bands generally form parabolas → Double differentiation results in a constant → Effective mass is constant

<br>

## **8\. Carriers and Current**

 ⑴ N atoms per band, 2 electrons per atom, at room temperature

**Figure. 7.** N atoms per band, 2 electrons per atom, at room temperature 

 ⑵ Band 4: All empty

 ⑶ Band 3: Mostly empty

 ⑷ Band 2: Mostly full

 ⑸ Band 1: All full

 ⑹ Band 4 has no electrons, net current = 0

 ⑺ Band 1 is fully occupied by electrons, net current = 0

 ⑻ Bands 2 and 3 must break symmetry for net current to exist

<br>

<br>

## **9\. Applications**

 ⑴ Why graphite conducts electricity: Electrons

 can move easily from HOMO to LUMO, similar to Na

 ⑵ Na has higher electrical conductivity than Mg: Metallic bonding → Single band
