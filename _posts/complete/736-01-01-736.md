 ⑴ Governing Equation

 ⑵ When fe is a trigonometric function

> ① Vibration = Natural vibration + Steady-state vibration

> ② Natural vibration = Homogeneous solution = Complementary solution = Transient solution

>> ○ As time passes, converges to 0 due to e-βt

> ③ Steady-state vibration = Particular solution

>> ○ Generally, only interested in particular solution

>> ○ Assumed as complex harmony

>> ○ (Note) ω ≪ ω0

>> ○ (Note) ω = ω0

>> ○ (Note) ω ≫ ω0

## **4\. Mechanical Impedance**

 ⑴ Definition

> ① Defined as Complex Driving Force ÷ Complex Velocity at Driving Point

> ② Concept of force magnitude for obtaining velocity

 ⑵ Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) system

> ① Zm **:** Inherent properties of the material. Predicts response

> ② Rm **:** Mechanical resistance. Energy loss

> ③ Xm **:** Mechanical reactance. Energy storage

> ④ If impedance is known, the response can be known

 ⑶ ω ≪ ω0 **:** Zm* = -js / ω

> ① Spring-like (stiffness-like) impedance

> ② Negative imaginary

> ③ Inversely proportional to frequency

 ⑷ ω = ω0 **:** Zm* = Rm

 ⑸ ω ≫ ω0 **:** Zm* = jωm

> ① Mass-like impedance

> ② Positive imaginary

> ③ Linearly proportional to frequency

 ⑹ Imaginary impedance **:** When Rm = 0

> ① Force and velocity are out of phase

> ② No power is required to drive the system

>> ○ Since Rm = 0, no energy is dissipated
