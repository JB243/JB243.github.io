## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Terminology

> ① Alpha carbon: The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl carbon

> ② Alpha hydrogen: The hydrogen attached to the alpha carbon

⑵ pK<sub>a</sub> of alpha hydrogens in carbonyl compounds

> ① Ketoesters: 11

> ② Diesters: 13

> ③ Amides: 15

>> The hydrogen on the nitrogen side

> ④ Aldehydes: 17

> ⑤ Ketones: 20

> ⑥ Esters: 25

>> ○ Thus, alpha hydrogens are more acidic in ketones and aldehydes compared to esters

> ⑦ **Formula 1.** Alpha hydrogens of carbonyl compounds are _**fairly acidic and exhibit a wide range of reactions**_: In contrast, allylic hydrogen has a pK<sub>a</sub> of about 44

> ⑧ **Formula 2.** When acid-base reaction is competing with other organic reactions, the **_fastest_** acid-base reaction is preferred.

⑶ Types of carbonyl compound reactions

> ① **Type 1.** When the basicity of Y<sup>-</sup> is greater than that of X<sup>-</sup>

<br/>

**Figure 1.** Carbonyl compound reaction Type 1

**Figure 2.** Carbonyl compound reaction Type 2

<br/>

> ③ **Type 3.** Enone and 1,2-addition reaction: Occurs when the nucleophile is a strong nucleophile (e.g., Grignard reagent)

<br/>

**Figure 3.** Carbonyl compound reaction Type 3

<br/>

> ④ **Type 4.** Enone and 1,4-addition reaction (Michael addition): Occurs when the nucleophile is a weak nucleophile (e.g., MeSH)

<br/>

**Figure 4.** Carbonyl compound reaction Type 4 

<br/>

>> ○ When the nucleophile attacks the alpha carbon: The intermediate does not exhibit resonance

>> ○ When the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon: The intermediate has two resonance structures. Since the intermediate is stable, this pathway is preferred.

>> ○ Since oxygen prefers to bear a negative charge when attacking the beta carbon, products like those in **Figure 4** are formed

<br>

**Figure 7.** Enol form is favored in some cases

<br>

> ⑤ Esters, carboxylic acids, and amides do not undergo tautomerization unlike ketones and aldehydes

>> ○ Reason: Oxygen in -OR attempts to form a double bond rather than -OH

⑹ Common aspects of alkylation reactions

> ① Kinetic control

>> ○ Influenced by steric effects

>> ○ Occurs at low temperatures (e.g., -76 °C)

>> ○ Slight excess of E<sup>+</sup> needed (e.g., 1.05 eq) due to the slow reaction

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/8a333d32-2110-46ad-82e3-803fd48eb58f)

**Figure 17.** Kinetic control product

<br>

> ② Thermodynamic control

>> ○ Influenced by stability of multi-substituted alkene intermediates

>> ○ Occurs at higher temperatures. Even if kinetic control product is formed, reaction may revert to thermodynamic control product due to reverse reaction

>> ○ Slight reduction of E<sup>+</sup> needed (e.g., 0.95 eq)

<br>

⑺ **Reaction 1-6.** Haloform reaction of methyl ketones

> ① Reaction conditions: 1. X<sub>2</sub>, KOH (water/dioxane), 2. HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O

>> ○ The 2<sup>nd</sup> reaction condition, HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O, acts as a proton source to convert O<sup>-</sup> to OH

>> ○ Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) or I<sub>2</sub>(g) can be used as X<sub>2</sub>

>> ○ CHX<sub>3</sub> is referred to as haloform

>> ○ CHI<sub>3</sub> is a yellow solid and is a famous precipitate used to determine the positivity of the reaction

> ② Insights

>> ○ **Insight 1.** If OH<sup>-</sup> attacks the ketone carbon, there is no chance for a reaction with X<sub>2</sub>, leading to the reverse reaction

>> ○ **Insight 2.** CH<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is not a good leaving group, so it reacts with X<sub>2</sub> to become a good leaving group, following [Reaction Type 1](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1377) 

> ③ **Significance**: Can produce carboxylic acids from ketones

<br>

<br>

<br>

## **3. Reaction 2.** Carbonyl alpha condensation reaction

 ⑴ Overview

> ① Alpha hydrogen of ketones is more acidic than that of esters

> ② E1cB (elimination unipolar conjugate base): Removal reaction occurs after formation of a conjugate base

> ③ Hydroxide is typically a poor leaving group, but resonance stabilization of the conjugate base can make the reaction possible.

 ⑵ **Reaction 2-1.** Halogenation of alpha carbon in ketones: Often uses ketone + acetic acid + Br<sub>2</sub> conditions as an example

<br>

<br>

⑶ **Reaction 2-2.** Aldol condensation reaction

> ① Characteristics

>> ○ When a carbonyl compound is more reactive towards nucleophilic addition reactions and cannot form an enolate anion, aldol condensatin reaction is most effective.

>> ○ (**Formula**) The hydrogen at the same carbonyl alpha position is removed twice.

>> ○ (**Formula**) Resonance stabilization results in the =O being released by OH-.

>> ○ (**Formula**) A carbonyl alpha carbon attacks another ketone carbon, removing the double-bonded oxygen; however, unsaturation is maintained, so a double bond must be formed between that carbonyl alpha carbon and the other ketone carbon.

>> ○ The aldol condensation is a type of dehydration condensation reaction.

>> ○ According to Bredt's rule, the aldol reaction may not occur.

> ② **Example 1.** Acid-catalyzed aldol condensation reaction: 2 × identical aldehydes

> ③ **Example 2.** Base-catalyzed aldol condensation reaction: 2 × identical aldehydes

**Figure 23.** Intramolecular Aldol Condensation Reaction

<br>

>> ○ In the above reaction, there can be two conjugate bases forming either a five-membered ring or a seven-membered ring.

>> ○ Among them, the five-membered ring is more stable, so the conjugate base forms to create the five-membered ring.

> ⑤ **Example 4.** Crossed Aldol Condensation: Two different aldehydes or aldehydes + ketones

**Figure 25.** Mechanism of Crossed Aldol Condensation

<br>

>> ○ Base is neutralized with HCl to prevent additional reactions.

>> ○ **Point:** 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one should be added **slowly**.

>>> ○ Removal of carbonyl α-hydrogen by OH<sup>-</sup> prefers 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one, which is present in small amounts during the reaction.

>>> ○ Dehydrogenated 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one reacts with the excess other aldehyde.

>>> ○ Without a larger amount of 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-one, a simple aldol condensation reaction can occur.

>> ○ 1-methylcyclohexanone + (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiCl, LDA, -78 ℃ → Kinetic silyl ether predominant.

<br>

>> ○ NaOEt is neutralized with HCl to prevent additional reactions.

>> ○ **Point 1:** Ethyl butanoate should be added slowly.

>>> ○ Carbonyl α-hydrogen elimination reaction by NaOEt prefers ethyl butanoate, which is present in small amounts during the reaction.

>>> ○ Dehydrogenated ethyl butanoate reacts with the relatively excess other ester.

>>> ○ Without a larger amount of ethyl butanoate, a simple Claisen condensation reaction can occur.

**Figure 32.** Ester Transesterification

<br>

>> ○ **Point 3:** In the case of crossed Claisen condensation, the reaction must be composed of the reaction between benzoate and non-benzoate

>>> ○ Alkyl benzoates cannot react with each other

>>> ○ Due to [aromatic side-chain effects](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370#8-aromatic-side-chain-effects), crossed Claisen reaction is faster than Claisen reaction between alkyl non-benzoates

>>> ○ When reactions are composed like ethyl propanoate + ethyl ethanoate, non-crossed Claisen reactions can occur significantly.

> ④ **Example 3.** Dieckmann Condensation Reaction

>> ○ **Intramolecular** Claisen Condensation. 1. NaOEt, 2. H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>

>> ○ Prefers 5-membered and 6-membered rings over 4-membered and 7-membered rings due to ring strain

> ⑤ **Example 4.** Darzens Condensation Reaction: EtONa, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N

⑻ **Reaction 2-7.** Robinson Annulation Reaction

> ① Definition: Ring-forming reaction between vinyl ketone and ketone

> ③ **Step 1.** [Amine Addition Reaction to Ketone](https://www.scripps.edu/baran/images/grpmtgpdf/Lockner_Nov_07.pdf)

>> ○ Reactivity differences based on the amine

>>> ○ Highly nucleophilic amines (pK<sub>a</sub> = 6-10, e.g., pyrrolidine): Reaction proceeds without acid catalysis. Dehydration is rate-determining.

>>> ○ Weakly nucleophilic amines (pK<sub>a</sub> = 3-5, e.g., Ph-NH-Me): Acid catalysis is required for the reaction and dehydration.

>>> ○ Acid catalyst: Strong acidic catalysts like p-TsOH are commonly used.

>> ○ Yield enhancement strategy: Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is generated as a result of the forward reaction, so its removal increases the yield.

>> ○ **Strategy 1.** Addition of chemically stable desiccants

>>> ○ Desiccants: CaCl<sub>2</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, MS, zeolite, etc.

>> ○ **Strategy 2.** Use of the Dean-Stark trap

>>> ○ Efficient removal of water or low-boiling solvents formed during the reaction

>>> ○ **Condition 1.** Use of an azeotropic mixture: Mixing solvent and co-solvent to maintain a constant boiling point

>>> ○ **Condition 2.** The boiling point of the azeotropic mixture should be higher than that of the low-boiling solvent

>>> ○ Examples of solvents used in Dean-Stark trap: Benzene ( _bp_. 80.1 ℃), toluene ( _bp_. 110.6 ℃), xylene (_bp_. 139.3 ℃)

>> ○ If H<sub>2</sub>O is not effectively removed, alcohol byproducts can form.
