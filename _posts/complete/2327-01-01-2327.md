※ Life doesn't give us many opportunities. That's why we should make the most of every opportunity.

<br>

## **1\. Why Europe?**

⑴ Recent shift of academic focus towards Europe

> ① In the U.S., research is capital-driven, but lacks creativity.

> ② Europe is known for creative and progressive research.

> ③ **Example 1:** Spatial transcriptomics Visium was developed by a Swedish research team.

> ④ **Example 2:** The European Society of Nuclear Medicine is larger than the American Society of Nuclear Medicine.

⑵ Duration of degrees

> ① U.S. **:** Even with a Master's degree, starting with an integrated Master's and Ph.D. program takes longer (5-6 years).

> ② Europe **:** A Master's degree is required to apply for a Ph.D. program, and the Ph.D. program is shorter (3-4 years).

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Why Zurich?**

⑴ LSZGS program at Zurich is almost the only option for applying in the first half of the year.

⑵ Unique advantages of Zurich

> ① Excellent living environment

> ② Many Nobel laureates

> ③ ETH Zurich Engineering is ranked within the global top 10, and University of Zurich is slightly higher than Seoul National University

> ④ Low tuition fees and high salary **:** As of 2023, Switzerland ($98,767, No. 4) has higher GDP per capita than the United States ($80,035, No. 7) ([ref](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alvinfsc_richest-countries-in-the-world-1980-2023-ugcPost-7105499229074178048-T8kN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

> ⑤ After Brexit, the UK is declining while the Switzerland-France-Germany region is rising centered around Basel

⑶ Prepares tension and resilience for the next round of applications in the latter half of the year.

> ⑧ Summary **:** The acceptance rate of the LSZGS program is only 5%, and there were rounds where all 4 Korean applicants were rejected.

⑵ [LSZGS Application Process](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2236#footnote_link_67_52)

> ① **Step 1.** submit application ( _e.g._ , ~01.07.2023)

> ② **Step 2.** wait for review ( _e.g._ , ~31.07.2023)

> ③ **Step 3.** select positions ( _e.g._ , ~08.08.2023)

⑶ When can you apply (July 1) to LSZGS and withdraw?

> ① [Withdrawal before document review results](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en/studies/application/faq/changeapplication.html) **:** Reapplication is possible in December.

> ② [Withdrawal before interview after document review results](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en/studies/application/faq/changeapplication.html) **:** Reapplication is possible in December.

> ③ [Withdrawal after interview](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en/studies/application/faq/changeapplication.html) **:** Reapplication is not possible in December.

> ④ Withdrawal after acceptance **:** Reapplication is not possible in December.

> ⑤ [Withdrawal after registration](https://www.students.uzh.ch/en/studyadmin/registration/deregister.html#:~:text=Studies%20not%20Commenced%20/%20Withdrawal%20of%20Matriculation) **:** Reapplication is not possible in December. Withdrawal is possible until March 15 of the following year.

⑷ If admitted to LSZGS, will I apply to the U.S.?

> ① Even if admitted to LSZGS, I am likely to apply to the U.S. again.

> ② **Reason 1.** A written oath submitted to KFAS.

> ③ **Reason 2.** Some U.S. graduate schools surely exceed LSZGS programs.

⑸ Why do I consider the LSZGS program application in July instead of December?

> ① Benefits of applying in July

>> ○ Strengthening the momentum for the second-half admission preparation

>> ○ (Both quantitatively and psychologically) easing the burden of second-half admissions

>> ○ The application competitiveness in December is approximately **1.5 times** that of July

>> ○ **Technological advancements are accelerating**, making it recommended to pursue a doctoral degree as early as possible

>> ○ My English scores are decreasing, so it's necessary to finish the admissions process **while English scores are still valid**

> ② Benefits of applying in December

>> ○ Can reapply in December to align with U.S. admissions timing

>> ○ LSZGS program appears to have moved up to November 2023, not December 2023.

> ③ Final Decision **:** Do not withdraw before the interview after LSZGS July application and try to get an acceptance.

⑹ If not admitted to LSZGS, what will you do?

> ① **Option 1.** U.S. application portal opens as early as August, so prepare around 10 ~ 20 U.S. applications in advance (adopted)

> ② **Option 2.** Some European Ph.D. programs accept applications until October 1 (e.g., [Max Planck Institute](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2328))

> ③ **Option 3.** Some UK Ph.D. programs are conducted on a rolling basis and require early applications

> ④ **Option 4.** Some U.S. Ph.D. programs accept applications until November 1 (e.g., MD-PhD program especially)

> ⑤ **Option 5.** Apply for ETH Zurich Engineering's [continuous hiring process](https://jobs.ethz.ch/site/index) (adopted)

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Applying to two programs is safer than applying to only one if you want to get into ETH.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Can make a positive appeal to the first-choice professor during the waiting process or when the matching result is announced.

⑺ Will you target University of Zurich or ETH Zurich Engineering?

> ① Area of interest **:** Spatial Bioinformatics

> ② Based on the priority set for the area of interest, will target both University of Zurich and ETH Zurich Engineering

> ③ **Final decision** **:** LSZGS (23.07.17), ETH Zurich × Roche (23.07.29)

>> ○ LSZGS did not have a structure where it was possible to select ETH Zurich and University of Zurich, separately.

⑻ If admitted to LSZGS, what about scholarships?

> ① 2023 Admission Plans

>> ○ **If admitted to ETH Zurich or University of Zurich** **:** Before the issuance of the Swiss visa, whether I get accepted into a graduate school in the US that is at least as reputable as UCLA is a critical point

<br>

>> ○ **If not admitted to any** **:** I will apply to around 10 ~ 20 U.S. graduate schools.

> ② If admitted to Zurich / Zurich Engineering, submit renunciation to [Higher Education Foundation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2214) and apply for one or more of the following scholarships
