## **1\. Hypotheses on the Origin of Life:** The realm of biochemists or physicists

 ⑴ Hypotheses on the Origin of Life

> ① Spontaneous Generation Theory: A theory that life arises spontaneously from inanimate matter (rejected)

>> ○ Inanimate matter + vitality (life force) → living organism

>> ○ Proposed by ancient Greeks, including Aristotle

> ② Biogenesis Theory: Life originates from pre-existing life **→** What is the origin of the first life? (Need supplementation)

>> ○ **Evidence 1:** Spallanzani's experiment

>> ○ **Evidence 2:** Pasteur's experiment (1862) **:** Using S-shaped flasks

> ③ Abiogenesis (= Chemical Evolution)

 ⑵ Hypotheses on the Origin of Life

> ① Theory of Celestial Origin **:** Bacteria arrived on Earth via meteorites (what about other planets?) (rejected)

>> ○ Counterexample: Amino acids in meteorites are a mixture of L-form and D-form, while living organisms use only L-form

> ② Creation Theory: Life originated as described in the Bible (potential for refutation ↓) (rejected)

> ③ Chemical Evolution Theory: Initial life emerged from chemical substances

 ⑶ Hypothesis on the Origin of Life from Inorganic Matter (Oparin, A. I; 1924) **:** Also known as the Coacervate-Oparin hypothesis

> ① Synthesis of the first organic molecules in Earth's inorganic matter

> ② Formation of polymers from organic monomers

> ③ Polymers initiate self-replication

> ④ Polymers with similar chemical properties aggregate, leading to the birth of the first life

<br>

<br>

## **2. Emergence of Primitive Organisms**

 ⑴ Primitive Earth's Environment

> ① Strongly reducing atmosphere

> ② Formation of oceans **:** Cooling of Earth led to condensation of H2O

> ③ Lightning, volcanic activity, and intense ultraviolet radiation

 ⑵ Formation of Early Organic Compounds

> ① Miller's experiment **:** Demonstrated the possibility of natural formation of organic compounds through inorganic processes in a primitive Earth rich in reducing gases

>> ○ Reducing gases **:** CH4, NH3, H2O, H2. Oxygen was scarce

>> ○ Inorganic processes **:** High temperature, discharges

>> ○ 1953 **:** Analysis of thin brown film on container wall and solution using paper chromatography

>> ○ 2008 **:** Reanalysis of residue using improved equipment **→** Discovery of 20 amino acids present in living organisms

> ② Fox's experiment

>> ○ Dropping organic solution onto hot sand or mud results in the formation of polymers due to concentration increase of monomers

>> ○ Protenoid **:** Polypeptides spontaneously formed from amino acids

>> ○ Hypothesis: Nucleic acids, proteins, ATP, and other polymer organic compounds likely synthesized in the primordial ocean

⑶ RNA World

> ① Evidence of the First Genetic Material being RNA

>> ○ **Evidence 1:** Spontaneous polymerization **:** RNA monomers can spontaneously form short RNA polymers

>> ○ **Evidence 2:** RNA can self-replicate without protein enzymes (complementary RNA strand)

>>> ○ DNA replication is more complex and requires many enzymes compared to RNA replication

>> ○ **Evidence 3:** RNA with catalytic function (ribozyme)

>>> ○ RNA's primary structure: Chain

>>> ○ RNA's secondary structure: Hairpin

>>> ○ RNA's tertiary structure: Ribozyme (examples: snRNA, 23s rRNA, 28s rRNA, RNase P (RNA cleavage enzyme function), RNase E)

>>> ○ Catalytic function: Can form complex 3D structures, contains highly reactive OH group

>>> ○ **Example 1:** RNA splicing, RNA polymerization reaction

>>> ○ **Example 2:** rRNA can catalyze peptide bond formation reaction

>>> ○ **Example 3:** Primary transcript of rRNA can self-remove introns without enzyme help

>>> ○ **Example 4:** Using small RNA molecules, cutting and joining E. coli tRNA primary transcripts is possible

>> ○ **Evidence 4:** Reverse transcriptase

> ② RNA World **:** Mixture of RNA monomers accidentally forms the first gene, leading to continuous formation of complementary strands

> ③ Coevolution of RNA and Proteins **:** Proteins generated by RNA provide protection and assistance to RNA

> ④ DNA-RNA system **:** Evolution of new enzymes that create DNA and RNA copies from DNA

⑷ RNA Substitution

> ① [RNA](https://jb243.github.io/pages/67) is inherently unstable

> ② After the RNA world, DNA begins to form, coexisting with RNA, and synthesis shifts from RNA to DNA

⑸ Pre-life Organisms **:** Very difficult to implement in reality

> ① Coacervate: Complex organic molecules in the primitive ocean form small enclosed liquid droplets

> ② Microspheres: Protenoids discovered by Fox, formed when organic monomers on hot sand or mud cool down and create small liquid droplets

> ③ Characteristics of Pre-life Organisms

>> ○ Selective absorption of substances

>> ○ Coacervates or microspheres evolved further into the first primitive life forms

⑹ First Life Form

> ① Genetic material is enclosed in a membrane, ensuring stability through confinement

> ② Birth of the first life form with energy mechanisms to overcome (negative entropy)

## **3. Emergence of Prokaryotes and the Oxygen Revolution**

⑴ First Life Form: Anaerobic nutrition-dependent organisms

⑵ Early Organisms' Genetic Strategies

> ① **Strategy 1:** Increased utilization of genes: Almost no meaningless genetic sequences

> ② **Strategy 2:** Elimination of unnecessary repetitive sequences: Repetitive sequences are necessary for sophisticated gene expression

> ③ Genetic Strategies of Later Organisms

>> ○ Tissue-specific enzymes abound

>> ○ Decreased gene utilization

>> ○ Increase in pseudogenes

⑶ Emergence of Simple Autotrophic Cells

> ① Birth of organisms that synthesize organic substances from CO2 using light as energy source due to energy depletion in the ocean

> ② First autotrophic cells likely used hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor with a simple photosystem

> ③ Examples: Purple sulfur bacteria, green sulfur bacteria, etc.

⑷ Appearance of Cyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae)

> ① Emergence of autotrophic cells capable of receiving electrons from water

>> ○ Fossil of ancient cyanobacteria: Stromatolites

> ② Cyanobacteria thrive and the produced oxygen changes the reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere, leading to the extinction of anaerobic organisms

>> ○ Active oxygen: Anaerobic organisms lacking means to remove oxygen are vulnerable to attack by reactive oxygen

>> ○ Formation of peroxisomes: Hypothesis that peroxisomes were a type of bacteria

> ③ **Oxygen Revolution**

>> ○ About 2 billion years ago, cyanobacteria gained dominance in competition with anaerobic organisms

>> ○ Oxygen Revolution: Cyanobacteria became dominant, resulting in a sudden increase in atmospheric oxygen

>> ○ Reduction atmosphere turned into an oxidizing atmosphere

> ④ After the Oxygen Revolution

>> ○ Oxygen-sensitive organisms go extinct: Oxygen damages proteins and nucleic acids as a strong oxidizing agent

>> ○ Ozone formation from oxygen → Ozone layer formation

>> ○ Birth of aerobic organisms utilizing oxygen: More ATP can be generated from the same amount of glucose

⑸ Emergence of Terrestrial Organisms: Ozone layer blocks ultraviolet radiation, allowing aquatic organisms to move to land

## **4. Origin of Eukaryotic Cells**

⑴ First Prokaryotic Cell (Approximately 3.5 billion years ago) **→** First Eukaryotic Cell (Approximately 2 billion years ago)

⑵ Oxygen Revolution → Formation of Radicals

> ① Radicals → Destruction of biomolecules → Cells grow larger to develop mechanisms to protect biomolecules

> ② Cell size increases → Decreased surface area-to-volume ratio → Decreased efficiency in material exchange → Folding of cell membrane needed to increase surface area

⑶ **Endosymbiotic Theory** (Membrane Infolding Theory)

> ① Plasma membrane folds inward to form intracellular compartments

> ② Sequence of organelle formation **:** Plasma membrane infolding → Formation of nuclear membrane and vesicles → Formation of vesicles from Golgi apparatus → Formation of lysosomes from Golgi apparatus

⑷ **Endosymbiotic Theory:** Proposed by Lynn Margulis

> ① 1<sup>st</sup> Step: Plasma membrane of anaerobic archaea folds inward into cytoplasm (plasma membrane infolding)

>> ○ Examples of anaerobic archaea: Proteobacteria

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup> Step: Nuclear membrane, vesicles, and Golgi apparatus become independent from the outer membrane

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup> Step: Ancestor eukaryote engulfs a heterotrophic bacterium capable of anaerobic respiration but doesn't kill it (1st intracellular symbiosis)

>> ○ Ancestor eukaryote was vulnerable to attacks from reactive oxygen due to its anaerobic nature; surviving with an anaerobic respiration bacterium likely offered an advantage

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup> Step: Anaerobic respiration bacterium survives inside eukaryote, and both evolve dependently (Mitochondria formation; generation of animal cells)

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup> Step: Ancestor of algae and terrestrial plants engulfs photosynthetic prokaryote (cyanobacteria), but doesn't kill it (2nd intracellular symbiosis)

> ⑥ 6<sup>th</sup> Step: Cells evolve interdependently (Chloroplast formation; generation of plant cells)

> ⑦ 7<sup>th</sup> Step: Repeated endosymbioses lead to the evolution of different groups of algae

⑸ Evidence for Endosymbiotic Theory: Observed in Mitochondria and Chloroplasts

> ① Most crucial evidence: Double membrane structure

> ② Circular DNA, 70S ribosomes, bacterial promoters and RNA pol, fMet-tRNA **:** Antibiotic sensitivity

>> ○ Nuclear DNA in eukaryotes is linear

>> ○ Eukaryotic cells have 80S ribosomes

>> ○ Circular DNA in chloroplasts encodes r-proteins (large subunit DNA is inserted into nuclear DNA)

> ③ Functional homology of membranes: Electron transport chain and chemical composition of outer membrane

>> ○ Cardiolipin in inner membranes

>> ○ Facultative bacteria have electron transport chain in plasma membrane; mitochondria have electron transport chain in inner membrane

⑹ Emergence of Multicellular Eukaryotes: Adaptation to various environments due to more functions than single-celled organisms
