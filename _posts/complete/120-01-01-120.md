Bars _BE_ and _CF_ are made of steel (_E_ = 200 GPa) and have cross-sectional areas of _BE_ = 11,100 mm² and _CF_ = 9,280 mm². The distance between various points on the bars are shown in the figure. Determine the vertical displacements _δA_ and _δD_ of points _A_ and _D_, respectively.

⑶ Thermal stress

> ① Thermal expansion: When the temperature of a component increases, its length increases in all directions due to increased kinetic energy.

>> ○ Linear expansion coefficient α and temperature change ΔT: Length ℓ = ℓ<sub>0</sub> (1 + α ΔT) for a linear object.

>> ○ Volumetric expansion coefficient β and temperature change ΔT: Total volume V = V<sub>0</sub> (1 + β ΔT) for an object.

>> ○ β ≒ 3α holds approximately: 1 + β ΔT = (1 + α ΔT)<sup>3</sup> ≒ 1 + 3α ΔT (proof)

>> ○ Thermal expansion coefficient: Zn, Pb, Mg ＞ W, Mo ＞ V

> ② Thermal stress: Stress that occurs when a component undergoes thermal expansion but the distance between two points cannot change.
