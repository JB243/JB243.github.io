## 1. Overview

#### ⑴ Principle **:** Simple is better

> ① Reason **:** Simple sentences can help deliver messages and allocate more brain resources to word choices

> ② Inspired by former U.S. President Donald Trump's way of speaking

> ③ Sentence type

>> ○ A is equal to B.

>> ○ A equals to B.

>> ○ A verb B.

>> ○ Adverbial phrase or adverbial clause, S + V.

>> ○ S+V, adverbial phrase or adverbial clause.

#### ⑵ Strategy

> ① I decided to simplify the sentences as much as possible and appeal for good pronunciation and advanced vocabulary choices.

> ② Using words like 'demonstrate', which have a longer phonetic duration and are general-purpose, is advantageous over forming idioms with simpler words.

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Words with a longer phonetic duration can convey the message more clearly to the listener without gaps in sound.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Words that are longer in sound are usually general-purpose, reducing word recall delay.

> ③ Present completion is more advantageous than simple past.

>> ○ **Reason 1.** The present completion can be used in the past tense and the present tense.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** Even if you say subject + p.p., you can make up for the mistake by understanding it as subject 've + p.p.'

>> ○ **Reason 3.** Even if you say subject 've have p.p.', you can make up for the mistake by understanding it as subject 'have + p.p.'

>> ○ **Reason 4.** Because the present completion has the effect of making the speech longer than in the past.

> ④ Multiple nouns are more advantageous than singular nouns because plural nouns do not require articles.

> ⑤ Progressive tense is more advantageous than simple tense: Even if you say the verb be by mistake, you can continue the sentence with the meaning of the verb.

> ⑥ If it's not a really familiar autologous verb, let's organize expressions focusing on transitive verbs becayse the autologous verb doesn't need an object, but it's awkward to use them.

>> ○ Example **:** Using 'terminate' rather than 'end'.

>> ○ However, if you use an automatic verb when you can use it, you can show your expertise.

> ⑦ Le's organize expression in passive rather than active **:**If the subject is omitted in active voice, English is a little awkward.

> ⑧ Use the past tense for auxiliary verbs.

> ⑨ Use personal pronouns as much as possible if you are the subject of a person.

> ⑩ If you use a lot of auxiliary verbs, you are less likely to make mistakes.

>> ○ **Reason 1.** Because the verb that follows the auxiliary verb is an infinitive verb.

>> ○ **Reason 2.** The past tense of the auxiliary verb gives a more formal feeling, but in many cases it is the same as the present tense of the auxiliary verb.

> ⑪ When speaking, small mistakes are usually tolerated. It's actually more problematic to speak without confidence and hesitate. 

>> ○ For example, even if you say "Who ever heard of this?" people will generally understand and interpret it as "Who has ever heard of this?"

#### ⑶ Real number pattern

> ① When using more + adjective comparative

> ② Confusion with "have p.p" and "have been p.p."

> ③ When using "also" at the end of a sentence **:** If it's a positive sentence you may use "too", and if it's a negative sentence or a question you may use "either." For both cases, you can use "as well".

> ④ When using 'much + countable verb'.
