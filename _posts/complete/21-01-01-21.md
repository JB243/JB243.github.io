## 1\. Problem 1. Thevenin - Norton Reversibility Example **:** Capacitor

**Figure 1.** Problem

<br>

<br> 

## **2\. Solution**

 ⑴ Purpose **:** To verify the reversibility of Thevenin equivalent circuit and Norton equivalent circuit in a circuit containing a capacitor.

 ⑵ Strategy **:** Confirming that the solutions for voltage (v) obtained from corresponding Thevenin circuit and Norton circuit are the same.

 ⑶ This strategy implies that the loading effect is the same.

 ⑷ Mathematical derivation
