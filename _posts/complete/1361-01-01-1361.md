## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Halogenated Alkyl (Alkyl Halide): Compounds in the form of R-X

> ① Examples: methyl halide, vinyl halide, aryl halide, allylic halide, benzylic halide

> ② Halogenated alkyl compounds are highly reactive: Due to the high electronegativity of halogen atoms, the halogen atom is easily detached

⑵ Properties According to Structure

> ① Carbon is a partially positive electrophile, halogen atoms are partially negative

> ② Reacting reagents are nucleophiles or bases

> ③ [Solvents](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359#5-solvents): H<sub>2</sub>O, ROH

⑶ Boiling and Melting Points

> ① If the number of carbons is the same, the boiling and melting points of halogenated alkyl compounds are higher than those of alkanes: Due to stronger intermolecular forces in halogenated alkyl compounds

> ② Boiling and melting points of halogenated alkyl compounds increase with larger R groups: Larger R groups lead to increased surface area and stronger intermolecular forces

> ③ Boiling and melting points of halogenated alkyl compounds increase with larger X atoms: Increased polarity leads to stronger intermolecular forces

⑷ Solubility

> ① Halogenated alkyl compounds are soluble in organic solvents

> ② Halogenated alkyl compounds are insoluble in water

⑸ Bond Strength: Decreases with larger X atoms

⑹ General Reaction

> ① Elimination reactions are predominant upon heating

⑵ **Mechanism Example 1.** Simultaneous breaking of reactant bonds and forming of product bonds (**S<sub>N</sub>2**)

<br>

**Figure 2.** Mechanism Example 1 of Nucleophilic Substitution Reaction

<br>

⑶ **Mechanism Example 2.** Reactant bonds break first, then product bonds form (**S<sub>N</sub>1**)

<br>

**Figure 3.** Mechanism Example 2 of Nucleophilic Substitution Reaction

<br>

⑷ **Mechanism Example 3.** Product bonds form first, then reactant bonds break (**Not possible**)

> ① Reason: Carbon, a second-period element, can accommodate a maximum of 8 valence electrons, making such a structure impossible

> ② Intermediate cannot exist; considered to exist as a transition state

**Figure 5.** Mechanism of S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction

<br>

> ① Occurs in one step

> ② Strong nucleophiles substitute weak nucleophiles, making it irreversible

> ③ MO Theory: σ* antibonding MO of central carbon and orbital of nucleophile interfere, forming a new bond

⑷ Sterechemistry

> ① Transition State: Trigonal bipyramidal (sp<sup>3</sup>d)

> ② Backside attack of nucleophile: Nucleophile attacks from the backside of the leaving group

> ③ Chiral center inversion

>> ○ RS nomenclature determination remains independent through inversion: RS designation before and after the reaction may stay the same or change

> ④ Racemization does not usually occur

>> ○ Exception: Iodide ion reversibility

⑸ **Rate Factors**: Substrate

> ① Principle: Higher electrophilic nature of α-carbon leads to faster reaction rate

> ② General trend

>> ○ **Trend 1.** Increased stability of transition state

>>> ○ α-halo carbonyl ＞ R-NH-<span style="color: red">C</span>H<sub>2</sub>-X ＞ R-O-<span style="color: red">C</span>H<sub>2</sub>-X ＞ Ph-<span style="color: red">C</span>H<sub>2</sub>-X, R=C-<span style="color: red">C</span>H<sub>2</sub>-X

**Figure 7.** Formation of an empty orbital approaching the nucleophile requires overlap between π* and σ*

<br>

>>> ○ α-halo carbonyl: Combination of π* (C=O) orbital and σ* (C-X) orbital forms lower-energy MO → Nucleophile attacks carbonyl carbon → Intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction occurs

>> ○ **Trend 2.** Halogenated alkyl compounds

>>> ○ Methyl RX ＞ 1<sup>st</sup> RX ＞ 2<sup>nd</sup> RX ＞ 3<sup>rd</sup> RX ＞ norbornane halide

>>> ○ Reason: Due to steric effects, activation energy of transition state varies

>> ○ **Trend 3.** Halogen atoms bonded to sp<sup>2</sup> carbons

>>> ○ ＞ aryl halide, vinyl halide

>>> ○ Backside attack is prohibited by VSEPR

>>> ○ Stronger C-X bond makes leaving group harder to detach

⑹ **Rate Factors**: Nucleophile

> ① Principle: Strong nucleophiles lead to faster S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions

> ② Weak base nucleophiles (Nu:): NaCN, KN3, RNH2, RCOONa. NaSR, NaBr, KI react with 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> RX

> ③ Strong base nucleophiles: NaOR, KC≡CH, NaNH<sub>2</sub>, etc., react with 1<sup>st</sup> RX, 2<sup>nd</sup> RX favors E2 reaction

> ④ Note, nucleophiles with pK<sub>a</sub> greater than 10 are referred to as strong base nucleophiles

⑺ **Rate Factors**: [Solvent](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359)

> ① [Polar Protic Solvent](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359),: Solvents with hydrogen bonding

>> ○ Examples: Water, EtOH, MeOH, etc.

> ② [Polar Aprotic Solvent](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359),: Solvents without hydrogen bonding

>> ○ Examples: Acetone, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), DMF (dimethyl formamide), etc.

> ③ [Nonpolar Solvent](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359),: Solvent with low polarity

>> ○ Requires catalysts like 4th ammonium salts, crown ethers for phase transition

> ④ **Case 1:** Neutral reactant and charged product

>> ○ Polar protic solvents decrease S<sub>N</sub>2 reactivity, thus polar aprotic or polar nonpolar solvents are preferred

> ⑤ **Case 2:** Neutral reactant and charged product

>> ○ Polar protic solvents stabilize partial charges better in transition state, thus S<sub>N</sub>2 rate increases in polar protic solvents

⑻ **Rate Factors**: Leaving Group

> ① S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction includes leaving group detachment in reaction rate, making leaving group a rate factor

> ② Rate increases as leaving group becomes more stable, i.e., as the basicity decreases

> ③ C-F bond is too strong, making detachment difficult

>> ○ Leaving group trend: C-F < C-Cl, C-Br < C-I

>> ○ Teflon: -(CF<sub>2</sub>-CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-. Remains stable even with heat

>> ○ Iodine's high polarity leads to easy C-I bond detachment

⑼ Advanced Theory

> ① Iodine Ion Reversibility

>> ○ <b>Issue:</b> Iodine ion S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is reversible due to similar basicity of nucleophile and leaving group, leading to coexistence of reactants and products (e.g., CH<sub>3</sub>Br + I<sup>-</sup> ⇄ CH<sub>3</sub>I + Br<sup>-</sup>).

>> ○ <b>Solution:</b> To suppress reverse reaction, reaction is conducted in acetone where KBr doesn't dissolve.

>> ○ Alkyl iodide continuously reacts with iodide ion to form racemic mixture.

<br>

**Figure 8.** Process of alkyl iodide becoming a racemic mixture

<br>

> ② Fluoride ion insolubility

>> ○ <b>Issue:</b> Fluoride ion's strong ionic nature makes it difficult to dissolve in aprotic solvents.

>> ○ As a result, S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction involving fluoride is less likely.

>> ○ <b>Solution:</b> Using phase transition catalysts like crown ethers can introduce chlorine ions into aprotic solvents.

> ③ Intermolecular and Intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 Reactions

>> ○ Competing relationship between intermolecular and intramolecular reactions

>> ○ Generally, intramolecular reactions proceed faster than intermolecular reactions: Intramolecular reactions increase entropy

>> ○ Conditions favoring intramolecular reactions: Low molecular concentrations, formation of 5-membered or 6-membered rings

⑽ Conclusion: S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions occur rapidly in substrates with minimal steric hindrance, strong nucleophiles, and polar aprotic solvents

## **4\. S<sub>N</sub>1 Reaction** 

⑴ Overview

> ① Unimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution

> ② 1<sup>st</sup> order

> ③ Remove and react, leading to carbocation

⑵ Introduction to Mechanism Background

> ① Reaction of t-butyl bromide with KOH: [E2 reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1361#footnote_link_67_55) occurs

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/2115ea7a-71f9-4223-9513-15e18660bb98)

**Figure 9.** Reaction of t-butyl bromide with KOH

<br>

> ② Reaction of _t_-butyl bromide with H<sub>2</sub>O

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/9c248381-8125-4efe-95ce-36a2625548de)

**Figure 10.** Reaction of t-butyl bromide with H<sub>2</sub>O

<br>

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> RX faces significant steric hindrance, making S<sub>N</sub>2 nucleophilic attack difficult

>> ○ Reaction rate is proportional only to _t_-butyl bromide concentration, making S<sub>N</sub>2 explanation unsuitable: Only possible when reactant bonds break and product bonds form

⑶ Reaction Rate Law

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/10182539-6f04-4b0e-b702-b4bece5f0f36)

<br>

⑷ Mechanism: 2-step reaction

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/d2c3e4be-5194-4bf4-82b0-fb78f07a1f40)

**Figure 11.** Mechanism of S<sub>N</sub>1 Reaction

<br>

> ① Carbocation formation: A type of solvolysis reaction

>> ○ Rate-determining step: Formation of carbocation in 1st step

> ② Vibrations of solvents can break C-Br bonds due to Boltzmann energy distribution

⑸ Sterechemistry

> ① In the above mechanism, water can add to the front or back of carbocation, allowing racemization for chiral substances

> ② In other words, chiral molecules can form through racemization via achiral intermediates

> ③ However, actual reactions favor inversion over retention: Perfect S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions are rare, and S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions also occur simultaneously

> ④ [Carbocation rearrangement reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1360#4-reaction-mechanism-step-by-step-description-of-reaction-processes) may occur to a more stable carbocation

<br>

**Figure 12.** An example of a S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction involving ring expansion due to a rearrangement reaction.

<br>

⑹ Reaction rate factors: Substrate

> ① Increase in the carbon degree of CX → stabilization of carbocations → decrease in activation energy of rate-determining step → increase in reaction rate

> ② Resonance stabilization causes stabilize carbocation intermediates, leading to faster S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction compared to the same degree of simple carbocation.

> ③ 1<sup>st</sup> alkyl halide: S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction doesn't occur due to the extreme instability of carbocations

⑺ Reaction rate factors:** Nucleophile

> ① General S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction conditions: Reaction between tertiary RX and weak nucleophiles such as H<sub>2</sub>O, ROH, RCOOH, excluding amines, etc.

> ② Strong nucleophile conditions: Especially in tertiary RX, E2 reactions occur

> ③ S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is the major reaction under weak nucleophile conditions like H<sub>2</sub>O, ROH (excluding RCOOH) even in 2<sup>nd</sup> RX

> ④ Solvolysis reaction: Generally, solvent is used as a nucleophile

⑻ Reaction rate factors: Solvent

> ① Polar protic solvents: Stabilize the carbon cation, leading to an increase in reaction rate

⑼ Reaction rate factors: Leaving group

> ① The weaker the bond between carbon and the leaving group, or the more stable the departing anion, the faster the leaving group ability, resulting in a faster S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction.

> ② Leaving ability is inversely proportional to the basicity of the leaving group

⑽ Reaction rate factors: Catalyst

> ① Ag<sup>+</sup> forms a complex with the leaving group, promoting the dissociation of the leaving group and increasing the rate of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction.

<br>

<br>

## **5. E2 Reaction**

<br>

⑷ Mechanism: One-step reaction, the bonds of reactants break simultaneously with the formation of bonds in products

<br>

<br>

> ① Alkali attacks the beta hydrogen, forming an intermediate which then reacts with X<sup>-</sup> and HB<sup>+</sup> detaching.

⑸ Sterechemistry

> ① Position-selective reaction: Saytzeff's rule (Zaitsev's rule)

<br>

**Figure 15.** Example of Zaitsev's Rule

<br>

>> ○ The more substituents there are, the more stabilized the alkene becomes.

>>> ○ **Explanation 1.** Interaction between anti-π (π*) bonding orbitals and adjacent σ orbitals through hyperconjugation.

>>> ○ **Explanation 2.**

>>>> ○ sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbons have a large s-character (33%), resulting in higher electronegativity.

>>>> ○ sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized carbons have a small s-character (25%), resulting in lower electronegativity.

>>>> ○ sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized carbons tend to donate electrons to sp2 hybridized carbons, hence more substituents lead to the stabilization of sp2 hybridized carbons.

>> ○ Hammond's Postulate

>>> ○ Definition: The transition state structure resembles the structure closer in energy.

>>> ○ For endothermic reactions, the energy order is reactants ＜ products ＜ transition state, so the transition state structure resembles the products.

>>> ○ For exothermic reactions, the energy order is products ＜ reactants ＜ transition state, so the transition state structure resembles the reactants.

>>> ○ Application: The rate of elimination reactions increases with more substituents on the product.

>>>> ○ According to Hammond's Postulate, transition state energy is lower for products with more substituents.

>>>> ○ The path leading from reactants to a more stable product in cases with many substituents has a lower transition state energy, resulting in a faster reaction rate.

>>> ○ Hammond's Postulate doesn't apply to all reactions beyond E2 reactions.

<br>

**Figure 16.** Other Reactions where Hammond's Postulate doesn't apply 

<br>

>> ○ Judging the major product when two or more alkenes are formed

>>> ○ Alkyl halides or bases with steric hindrance: Consider the path involving steric hindrance to determine the major product.

>>> ○ E2 elimination reactions by EtO<sup>-</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> generally follow Zaitsev's rule.

>> ○ Exceptions

>>> ○ When concomitant conformational stability is more favorable than the number of substituents, e.g., 4-chloro-5-methyl-1-hexene.

>>> ○ Alkyl fluoride, e.g., 2-fluoropentane.

>>> ○ Hofmann elimination reaction

>>> ○ When C-X bonds are rigid

<br>

**Figure 17.** Position-selective reactions of E2 mechanism depending on the C-X bond.

<br>

>>>> ○ When the C-X bond is strong (e.g., X = F): Follows path ⒜. ㈎ is more stable than ㈏ due to steric hindrance.

>>>> ○ When the C-X bond is weak (e.g., X = I, OTs): Follows path ⒝. The intermediate of the multi-substituted alkene is more stable due to thermodynamics.

> ② Stereoselective Reaction: Selective in terms of stereochemistry for a single reactant

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/d0857156-fb08-486c-8367-4a7fe455407e)

**Figure 18.** E2 Elimination Reaction and Stereoselective Reaction

<br>

>> ○ Particularly, when there are two beta hydrogens, stereoselective reactions can occur.

>> ○ Example: _trans_ alkene as the major product, _cis_ alkene as the minor product.

> ③ Stereospecific Reaction

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/cbd068c5-0974-4923-9f59-9ea28031ebf2)

**Figure 19.** _anti_-Periplanar Rule in E2 Reaction (X and Ha are departing in the reaction)

<br>

>> ○ Periplanar arrangement: Geometric arrangement with four atoms in the same plane.

>> ○ **Case 1:** _anti_-addition

>>> ○ _anti_-periplanar arrangement: C-H and C-L(L: leaving group) have a 0° dihedral angle in the periplanar arrangement.

>>> ○ In this case, the _anti_-periplanar arrangement means that H and X atoms are arranged on opposite sides of the molecule.

>>> ○ When the leaving group and acidic hydrogen have a 180° dihedral angle (anti), E2 elimination reaction can occur.

>>> ○ _anti_-periplanar arrangement is a **staggered conformation**, thus _anti_-addition occurs frequently.

>>> ○ Dihedral angles between 175-179° are sufficient for _anti_ -addition.

>>> ○ E2 reaction of cyclohexane halides: The major product is when the <i>anti</i>-addition occurs with chair-form.

>> ○ **Case 2:** _syn_-addition

>>> ○ _syn_-periplanar arrangement: C-H and C-L(L: leaving group) have a 0° dihedral angle in the periplanar arrangement.

>>> ○ In this case, the _syn_-periplanar arrangement means that H and X atoms are arranged on the same side of the molecule.

>>> ○ When the leaving group and acidic hydrogen have a 0° dihedral angle (eclipsed), E2 elimination reaction can occur.

>>> ○ _syn_-periplanar arrangement is an **eclipsed conformation**, thus _syn_-addition doesn't occur frequently.

>>> ○ E2 elimination reactions related to cyclopentane mostly follow _syn_-addition.

>> ○ Caution

>>> ○ _anti_-periplanar rule takes precedence over Saytzeff's rule.

>>> ○ Complex problems involve the application of stereospecific reactions in nine out of ten cases.

⑹ Reaction Rate Factors

> ① Substrate: Reaction rate increases as the degree of the substrate increases (**∵** Zaitsev's rule).

>> ○ CH<sub>3</sub>-X ＜ 1° RX ＜ 2° RX ＜ 3° RX

>> ○ Reason: Transition state involves partial secondary bonding, stabilizing the transition state with increased substituents through hyperconjugation.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/1befde6b-5f49-4c37-90e5-6f26d7932188)

**Figure 20.** Transition State with Partial Secondary Bonding in E2 Reaction

<br>

> ② Nucleophile: Reaction rate increases with higher nucleophilicity.

> ③ Solvent

>> ○ <b>Rate comparison:</b> Polar protic solvent ＜ Nonpolar solvent ＜ Polar aprotic solvent

>> ○ Polar positive solvents stabilize nucleophiles and decrease reaction rates.

> ④ Leaving Group: Reaction rate increases with more stable leaving groups.

> ⑤ Deuterium Substitution

>> ○ Assume that deuterium is heavier, making it less likely to dissociate a carbon-deuterium bond.

>> ○ Since hydrogen elimination is the rate-determining step (RDS) for E2 reactions, the presence of deuteriums slows down the E2 reaction rate.

> ⑥ In cases where E2 reaction conditions and -OH groups coexist in a molecule, H<sup>+</sup> elimination by strong bases from -OH takes precedence.

>> ○ Reason: Terminal acid-base reactions are very fast reactions.

<br>

⑶ Mechanism: Two-step reaction, the formation of a carbocation in the first step is the rate-determining step.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/d22890c7-98fc-4fa1-a47b-7b1198a49acf)

> ① Formation of a carbocation: A kind of solvolysis reaction

>> ○ Rate-determining step: Formation of a carbocation in the first step

⑷ Stereochemistry

> ① E1 reactions also follow [Zaitsev's rule](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1361#:~:text=regioselective%20reaction) like E2 reactions.

> ② Due to the involvement of carbocation intermediates, [rearrangement reactions](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1360#:~:text=%E2%97%8B-,%EC%9E%90%EB%A6%AC%EC%98%AE%EA%B9%80%EB%B0%98%EC%9D%91,-%EC%9D%98%20%EC%9B%90%EC%9D%B8) to more stable carbocation can occur.

⑸ Reaction Rate Factors

> ① Substrate

>> ○ 3° benzyl ≃ 3° allyl ＞ 2° benzyl ≃ 2° allyl ≃ 3° alkyl ＞ 1° benzyl ≃ 1° allyl ≃ 2° alkyl ＞ 1° alkyl ＞ methyl ＞ vinyl carbocations

>> ○ Influenced by the stability of intermediate carbocations

>> ○ Reaction that forms carbocation is the rate-determining step (rate-determining step)

>> ○ Carbocation stabilizes with more substituents

>> ○ Energy difference in transition states is smaller than the energy difference in intermediate carbocations.

> ② Solvent

>> ○ Reaction rate significantly influenced by the extent of carbocation stabilization.

>> ○ Nonpolar solvent ＜ Polar aprotic solvent ＜ Polar protic solvent

## **7\. E1cB Reaction** 

⑴ Overview

> ① Definition: Elimination reaction occurring when the substrate is β-halo carbonyl or β-hydroxy carbonyl.

> ② unimolecular elimination conjugate base

> ③ **Condition 1:** Presence of acidic hydrogen.

> ④ **Condition 2:** Presence of poor leaving group.

⑵ Mechanism

> ① **Step 1:** Strong base removes acidic hydrogen.

> ② **Step 2:** Hydrogen removal leads to resonance with ketone, forming an oxygen anion.

> ③ **Step 3:** Resonance of the oxygen anion leads to the departure of the leaving group and formation of a double bond.

## **8\. Bredt's Rule**

⑴ Bredt's Rule

> ① Rule

>> ○ **** In bridged bicyclic compounds, double bonds (π-bonds) cannot be present at bridgehead carbons.

>> ○ Bridgehead carbons in bridged bicyclic compounds cannot be carbocations.

> ② Reason

>> ○ Sterically hindered trigonal planar geometry of sp<sup>2</sup> cannot form due to structural constraints.

>> ○ Three carbons linked to the bridgehead carbon cannot lie in the same plane, preventing p-orbital overlap and making a trigonal planar arrangement unstable.

> ③ Application

>> ○ S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions on bridgehead carbons are impossible: Backside attack is impossible.

>> ○ S<sub>N</sub>1 reactions on bridgehead carbons are impossible: Carbocation formation is impossible.

>> ○ E2 and E1 reactions on bridgehead carbons are impossible: Formation of double bonds is impossible.

>> ○ For other carbons, S<sub>N</sub>2, S<sub>N</sub>1, E2, and E1 reactions are possible.

>> ○ In the case of E2 elimination reactions occurring in other carbons, the _anti_ elimination reaction is not favored, but rather the _syn_ elimination reaction.

**Figure 22.** When bridgehead carbon becomes a carbocation (impossible)

<br>

⑵ Anti-Bredt's rule

> ① Rule

>> ○ When a ring with 8 or more carbons is present, Bredt's rule cannot be applied.

>> ○ **Example 1:** bicyclo[3.3.1]non-1-ene: The smallest compound where double bonds can form on bridgehead carbons under normal conditions.

> ② Reason

>> ○ In cycloalkenes, starting from an 8-membered ring, trans can exist.

> ③ Application

>> ○ S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions are still impossible ( **∵** backside attack is impossible).

>> ○ S<sub>N</sub>1, E2, and E1 reactions can occur.

⑶ Grignard reactions can occur even when Bredt's rule is applicable.

> ① Reason: Because bridgehead carbons become sp3 carbon cations.

## **9. S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction vs S<sub>N</sub>1 Reaction **

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup> step reaction vs 2<sup>nd</sup> step reaction

⑵ Bimolecular reaction vs Unimolecular reaction

⑶ Substrate

> ① **S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction**: Reaction rate increases as steric hindrance decreases. Methyl group > 1° > 2°

>> ○ Reaction does not occur with 3° carbons.

>> ○ Exception: In the case of neopentyl bromide, due to steric hindrance, although it's 1°, the reaction is about 500 times slower than 2°.

> ② **S<sub>N</sub>1 Reaction**: Reaction rate increases as carbocation stability increases. 3° > 2°

>> ○ Reaction does not occur with methyl and 1° carbons.

⑷ Nucleophile

> ① **S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction**: Strong nucleophiles are favored.

> ② **S<sub>N</sub>1 Reaction**: Nucleophilicity does not significantly affect reaction rate. Mild nucleophiles are used to increase reaction selectivity.

⑸ Stereochchemistry

> ① **S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction**: Inversion of configuration.

> ② **S<sub>N</sub>1 Reaction**: Both inversion and retention of configuration occur simultaneously, leading to racemization.

| Secondary | S<sub>N</sub>1/E1(Slow) | S<sub>N</sub>2 (+ S<sub>N</sub>1, E2) | E2 | E2 |
| Tertiary | S<sub>N</sub>1/E1 | S<sub>N</sub>1/E1 | E2 | E2 |
| β-halo carbonyl or β-hydroxy - | E1cB | E1cB | E1cB | E1cB |
​
**Table. 1.** Determining Mechanism

[E1cB reaction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1382) is similar in nature to E2 elimination.

<br>

> ① Very weak base: H<sub>2</sub>O, ROH, etc.

> ② Weak base: X<sup>-</sup>, SR<sup>-</sup>, CN<sup>-</sup>, N<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, RCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, NR<sub>3</sub>, PR<sub>3</sub>, etc.

>> ○ S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions dominate with 2° RX.

>> ○ Neutral nucleophiles (e.g., NR<sub>3</sub>, PR<sub>3</sub>) are weak bases, but ammonia and amines are classified as strong nucleophiles.

> ③ Strong base + Steric hindrance ×: OH<sup>-</sup>, RO<sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, etc.

> ④ Strong base + Steric hindrance ○: LDA, DBN, DBU, t-BuO<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ E2 reactions dominate with 1° RX.

>> ○ DBN (1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene)

>> ○ DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene)

⑵ [Solvent](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1359#5-solvents)

⑶ Substrate

> ① 1° RX primarily undergo S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, but if the substrate has severe steric hindrance or a non-nucleophilic strong base is present, E2 reactions occur.

> ② 2° RX competitively undergo S<sub>N</sub>2 and E2 reactions.

>> ○ When the pK<sub>a</sub> of the leaving group is below 12, S<sub>N</sub>2 products are major products. However, clear distinction is not always possible.

>> ○ When the pK<sub>a</sub> of the leaving group is above 12, E2 products are major products. However, clear distinction is not always possible.

> ③ 2° RX forms products through all mechanisms, so the strength of the nucleophile (or base) should be considered.

>> ○ 2-bromoheptane + NaOCH<sub>3</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub>OH: Strong nucleophile is present. Therefore, S<sub>N</sub>2 and E2 reactions occur.

>> ○ 2-bromoheptane + CH<sub>3</sub>OH + heat(Δ): Reaction conditions favor solvent reaction conditions. Therefore, S<sub>N</sub>1/E1 reactions occur.

> ④ 3° RX undergo E2 reactions under strong base conditions, and S<sub>N</sub>1/E1 reactions under mild base conditions.

⑷ Nucleophile

> ① Neutral nucleophiles like ammonia and amines perform S<sub>N</sub>2 or E2 reactions.

> ② Preferred nucleophiles for S<sub>N</sub>2: X<sup>-</sup>, SR<sup>-</sup>, CN<sup>-</sup> ( **Important** ), RCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ( **Important** ), NH<sub>3</sub>, Et<sub>3</sub>N

> ③ Preferred bases for E2: OH<sup>-</sup> ( **Important** ), RO<sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ( **Important** ), LDA, DBN, DBU, t-BuOK( **Important** )

>> ○ Zaitsev's rule (Saytzeff's rule): Thermodynamically stable alkene is obtained.

>> ○ Hofmann rule: Kinetically favored product is obtained.

>> ○ Preferred bases for Zaitsev's rule: OH<sup>-</sup>, MeO<sup>-</sup>, EtO<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ Preferred bases for Hofmann rule: t-BuOK, LHMDS, LDA, DBN, DBU, or sterically hindered bases

⑸ Other

> ① S<sub>N</sub>1 and E1 reactions both involve carbocation intermediates, resulting in a mixture of substitution and elimination products.

>> ○ Generally, S<sub>N</sub>1 is more dominant than E1.

>> ○ Example: _tert_ -Bu-Br + EtOH yields 81% S<sub>N</sub>1 product and 19% E1 product.

> ② Substitution reactions are favored with mild bases, while elimination reactions are favored with strong bases.

> ③ As temperature increases, E1 elimination reactions are favored, and as temperature decreases, S<sub>N</sub>1 substitution reactions are favored.

>> ○ ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, as temperature increases, the entropy factor is enhanced, favoring elimination reactions.

>> ○ S<sub>N</sub>1 Substitution Reaction

>>> ○ Carbocation intermediate + :Nu<sup>-</sup> → Product

>>> ○ 2 reactants, 1 product

>>> ○ Δn = -1, entropy decreases

>> ○ E1 Elimination Reaction

>>> ○ Carbocation intermediate + :B → Product + HB<sup>+</sup>

>>> ○ 2 reactants, 2 products

>>> ○ Δn = 0, negligible change in entropy

>> ○ Considering temperature for determining major product in **S<sub>N</sub>1/E1** reactions is rare.

> ④ AgNO<sub>3</sub> conditions: Removes the eliminated halide.

>> ○ **Effect 1:** Increases S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction rate.

>> ○ **Effect 2:** 1° RX also follows S<sub>N</sub>1 mechanism.
