## **1. Problem 1**

 ⑴ Problem

> ① A **:** A is a random variable representing the number of times a heads appears when tossing a coin n+1 times.

> ② B **:** B is a random variable representing the number of times a heads appears when tossing a coin n times.

> ③ P(A ＞ B)?

 ⑵ Solution

> ① A* **:** A* is a random variable representing the number of times a heads appears when tossing a coin n times.

> ② B* **:** B* is a random variable representing the number of times a heads appears when tossing a coin n times.

> ③ P(A* ＞ B*) = P(A* ＜ B*)

> ④ P(A* ＞ B*) + P(A* = B*) + P(A* ＜ B*) = 1

> ⑤ P(A ＞ B) = P(A ＞ B <span>|</span> A* ＞ B*) + P(A ＞ B <span>|</span> A* = B*) + P(A ＞ B <span>|</span> A* ＜ B*)

>> ○ P(A ＞ B ∩ A* ＞ B*) = 1

>> ○ P(A ＞ B ∩ A* = B*) = 1/2

>> ○ P(A ＜ B ∩ A* ＜ B*) = 0

> ⑥ P(A ＞ B) = P(A* ＞ B*) + 1/2 P(A* = B*) = 1/2 (P(A* ＞ B) + P(A* = B*) + P(A* ＜ B*)) = 1/2

 ⑶ Comment

> ① Calculating algebraically is challenging

**2. Problem 2.** Bayes' Theorem

 ⑴ Premises

> ① A pharmaceutical company claims that their new drug improves memory with a probability of 0.8.

> ② A memory test is conducted on 20 subjects.

> ③ If the drug is effective, the test scores always increase.

> ④ If the drug is not effective, there is a 0.5 probability of test scores increasing.

> ⑤ If the drug is not effective, there is a 0.5 probability of test scores decreasing.

> ⑥ Among the 20 subjects, 16 show an increase in test scores.

 ⑵ Definitions

> ① M **:** Event of memory improvement

> ② N **:** Event of no change in memory

> ③ S **:** Event of an increase in test scores

> ④ T **:** Event of 16 out of 20 subjects showing an increase in test scores

> ⑤ F<sub>1</sub> **:** Event of the pharmaceutical company's claim being true

> ⑥ F<sub>2</sub> **:** Event of the pharmaceutical company's claim being false

 ⑶ **Problem 1.** P(T <span>|</span> F<sub>1</sub>) **:** Probability of the result occurring if the pharmaceutical company's claim is true

> ① **Approach 1.**

<br>

 ⑸ **Problem 3.** P(F<sub>1</sub> <span>|</span> T) **:** Probability that the pharmaceutical company's claim is true after conducting the test

## **3. Problem 3.** Joint Probability Distribution

 ⑴ Problem

> ① There is a beach with a length of ℓ km starting from the origin.

> ② Select an arbitrary point.

> ③ Select an arbitrary point within the interval from the origin to the selected point.

> ④ Y **:** Distance from the origin to the initially selected point

> ⑤ X **:** Distance from the origin to the finally selected point

## **4. Problem 4**

 ⑴ Problem

> ① X **:** Number of people who correctly receive their own hats after randomly redistributing hats from n people.

> ② Find E(X) and VAR(X).

 ⑵ Change of Perspective

> ① X<sub>i</sub> **:** If the i-th person receives their own hat, X<sub>i</sub> = 1; otherwise, X<sub>i</sub> = 0.

> ② X = X<sub>1</sub> + ··· + X<sub>n</sub>

 ⑶ E(X)

<br>

> ① Key **:** E(X<sub>i</sub>) = 1/n

> ② **Interpretation 1:** Approach based on counting possibilities

<br>

> ③ **Interpretation 2:** The expected value of whether the i-th person receives their own hat or not is constant due to symmetry.
