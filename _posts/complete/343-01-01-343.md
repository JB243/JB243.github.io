## **1\. Celestial Sphere and Coordinate System**

 ⑴ Celestial Sphere

> ① An imaginary infinite spherical sky with the observer on Earth as the center.

> ② Earth's center is the center of the celestial sphere.

 ⑵ Positions on the Celestial Sphere

> ① Zenith and Nadir **:** The points where the observer's vertical line intersects the celestial sphere.

>> ○ Vertical Circles **:** Circles passing through the zenith and nadir.

> ② Horizon and Others

>> ○ Horizon **:** Circle formed by extending the plane of the horizon to intersect the celestial sphere.

>> ○ Altitude Circle **:** All circles parallel to the horizon.

>> ○ Meridian **:** Equator of the celestial sphere, also known as vertical circle.

> ③ Poles

>> ○ North Pole and South Pole of the Celestial Sphere **:** Points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects the celestial sphere.

>> ○ Equator of the Celestial Sphere **:** Circle formed by extending Earth's equator to intersect the celestial sphere.

>> ○ Hour Circles **:** Circles passing through the celestial sphere's north and south poles.

> ④ Meridian **:** The unique circle passing through zenith, nadir, and celestial poles.

> ⑤ When considering an observer on the opposite side of the Earth's center, simply reverse the observer's orientation for the same celestial sphere.

>> ○ This is useful for extending interpretations from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere.

 ⑶ Coordinates of Celestial Objects

> ① Equatorial Coordinate System

>> ○ Latitude

>> ○ Longitude

>> ○ Example **:** When it is 00:20 AM on January 26th in Location A (34.2°N, 135°E), what time is it in Location B (34.2°N, 120°W)?

> ② Horizontal Coordinate System **:** Interpreted with zenith, nadir, and the horizontal plane as the center.

>> ○ Cardinal Points

>>> ○ North Point **:** Point closest to the celestial pole in the intersection of the horizon and the meridian.

>>> ○ South Point **:** Point closest to the southern celestial pole in the intersection of the horizon and the meridian.

>>> ○ East Point **:** Point 90° east from the north point along the horizon.

>>> ○ West Point **:** Point 90° west from the north point along the horizon.

>> ○ **Horizontal Coordinates** **:** Coordinate system indicating celestial object's position using azimuth and altitude relative to the horizon and the north point.

>>> ○ Azimuth (A) **:** Angle clockwise from the north point when projecting a star onto the horizon.

>>> ○ Altitude (h) **:** Angle measured vertically from the horizon to the celestial object.

>> ○ Zenith Distance (Z) **:** Angle from zenith to the celestial object.

<center>Z = 90° \- h</center>

>> ○ When observing the same star from two points with different latitudes, the time the star stays above the horizon increases with higher latitude.

>>> ○ Reason **:** The angle between the hour circle and the horizon decreases, resulting in longer visibility.

>>> ○ As the time the star is above the horizon increases, the difference in azimuth angle when the star rises and sets also increases.

>>> ○ (Note) Considering circumpolar stars in the Northern Hemisphere can help understand this phenomenon.

>> ○ When observing two stars rising, the higher the star's declination, the longer it stays above the horizon.

>>> ○ (Note) Considering circumpolar stars in the Northern Hemisphere can help understand this phenomenon.

>> ○ The difference in azimuth angles of two stars when they rise is greater at higher latitudes.

>>> ○ Combining the above two phenomena leads to understanding.

 ③ Equatorial Coordinate System **:** Interpreted with celestial poles and equator as the center.

>> ○ Right Ascension (α) **:** Angle between the vernal equinox and the hour circle of a celestial object. 0h to 24h, 1h = 15°.

>>> ○ From the vernal equinox along the celestial equator to the celestial object. West → East.

>>> ○ Right ascension of the vernal equinox is defined as 0h.

>> ○ Declination (δ) **:** Altitude of a star when it is located due south. -90° ± 90° (North (+), South (-)).

>>> ○ From the celestial equator along the hour circle to the celestial object. Upward or downward.

>>> ○ Vernal Equinox, Autumnal Equinox **:** Declination = 0°.

>>> ○ Summer Solstice **:** Declination = 23.5°.

>>> ○ Winter Solstice **:** Declination = -23.5°.

>> ○ **Equatorial Coordinates** **:** Coordinate system representing celestial object's position using right ascension and declination.

>>> ○ Feature **:** Coordinates remain constant regardless of time and location.

> ④ Meridian Altitude

>> ○ Definition **:** Altitude of a celestial object when it is located on the southern meridian.

>> ○ Meridian Altitude = 90° \- Latitude + Declination

>> ○ 90° \- Latitude **:** Altitude of the intersection between the celestial equator's declination and the southern meridian in the horizontal coordinate system.

>> ○ (Note) Meridian altitude should be considered with respect to the horizontal coordinate system.

> ⑤ Ecliptic Coordinate System

>> ○ Ecliptic Coordinates **:** Coordinates representing star positions with the ecliptic plane as the reference.

>> ○ Ecliptic Latitude, Ecliptic Longitude

>> ○ Since the Sun orbits counterclockwise around the ecliptic, ecliptic latitude becomes zero, but ecliptic longitude increases like time.

  ⑷ Names of Stars

> ① Equatorial Stars in the Northern Hemisphere

> ② Equatorial Stars near the Ecliptic

> ③ Equatorial Stars in the Southern Hemisphere

> ④ 12 Zodiac Constellations **:** Dividing the ecliptic into 12 equal parts of 30° each, centered on the vernal equinox, and selecting stars closest to those division points, creating 12 constellations.

## **2\. Time and Calendar**

 ⑴ Sidereal Time and Solar Time

> ① Sidereal Time **:** Time determined by the position of stars.

> ② Solar Time **:** Time determined by the position of the Sun.

  ⑵ Solar Time

> ① Apparent Solar Time

> ② Mean Solar Time

> ③ Equation of Time = Apparent Solar Time - Mean Solar Time = Mean Sun's Right Ascension - Apparent Sun's Right Ascension

  ⑶ Standard Time and Local Time

> ① Local Mean Solar Time = GMT + L ／15

> ② 1 Solar Year = 365.2422 Mean Solar Days = 366.2422 Sidereal Days

  ⑷ Earth's Revolution and Seasons

  ⑸ Calendar

> ① Lunar Calendar

> ② Solar Calendar

  ⑹ Tidal Motion

> ① French Republican Calendar

> ② World Calendar
