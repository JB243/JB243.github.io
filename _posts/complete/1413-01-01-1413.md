## **1\. Gluconeogenesis**

⑴ Animal cells **:** Occurs in the liver.

⑵ Hormone control

> ① Glucagon, glucocorticoid **:** Promote gluconeogenesis.

> ② Insulin **:** Inhibits gluconeogenesis.

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Mechanism for gluconeogenesis** **:** The reverse reaction of glycolysis.

⑴ Coversion **:** Pyruvate → OAA

> ① Enzyme **:** Pyruvate carboxylase, located in mitochondria lumen.

> ② Acetyl coA promotes pyruvate carboxylase → It inhibits glycolysis → Less acetyl coA is produced.

⑵ Conversion **:** Oxaloacetic acid → PEP

> ① Enzyme **:** PEP carboxykinase, located in **cytoplasm** 

> ② Uses 1 GTP per OAA.

⑶ Conversion **:** Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate → Fructose-6-phosphate

> ① Enzyme **:** FBPase(fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase), located in **cytoplasm**

>> ○ Reverse reaction enzyme **:** PFK-1, located in cytoplasm.

> ② Allosteric control of enzyme **:** Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate(inhibitor), Glucagon(activator), Insulin(inhibitor)

⑷ Conversion **:** Glucose-6-phosphate → Glucose

> ① Enzyme **:** Glucose-6-phosphatase, located in **smooth ER**

>> ○ Reverse reaction enzyme **:** Hexokinase, located in cytoplasm.

⑸ Conversion **:** Glucose-6-phosphate → Glucose-1-phosphate

⑹ Glucose-1-phosphate **:** It can be added to the 4th or the 6th carbon of non-reducing group of glycogen chains by means of dehydration-condensation reaction.  

⑺ Phosphorylation, Dephosphorylation **:** Glycogen phosphorylase

> ① Insulin **:** Dephosphorylation

> ② Glucagon **:** Phosphorylation

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Cori cycle**

⑴ Gluconeogenesis from lactic acid, which takes place in liver.

> ① There is no gluconeogenesis from alcohol; consider alcohol fermentation can't be observed in human.

⑵ Process

> ① The liver sends glucose to skeletal muscle.

> ② Skeletal muscle produces lactic acid.

> ③ Generated lactic acid is sent back to the liver.

> ④ Liver synthesize glucose.

⑶ When actively exercising,

> ① Skeletal muscle **:** NADH → NAD+ is so slow reaction so that  NAD+/NADH gets low.

> ② Liver **:** In liver, glycolysis normally takes place so that NAD+/NADH gets high.

<br>

## **4\. Glyoxylate acid cycle**

⑴ Definition **:** Glucose synthesis pathway of plants

⑵ Place **:** Occurs through lipid body, glyoxisome, mitochondria.
