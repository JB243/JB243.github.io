## **1\. Gluconeogenesis**

⑴ Overview

> ① Gluconeogenesis: Reverse Process of Glycolysis

> ② Animal Cells: Occurs in the liver

> ③ Hormonal Regulation

>> ○ Glucagon, Glucocorticoid: Promote gluconeogenesis

>> ○ Insulin: Inhibits gluconeogenesis

> ④ Leucine, Lysine: These two amino acids cannot undergo gluconeogenesis from amino acids

> ⑤ Drinking alcohol without eating inhibits gluconeogenesis, leading to an increase in ketone bodies

⑵ Conversion of Pyruvate to OAA (Oxaloacetic Acid)

> ① Enzyme: Pyruvate Carboxylase, located inside the mitochondria

> ② Negative Feedback: Acetyl-CoA promotes pyruvate carboxylase → increases gluconeogenesis, decreases glycolysis → decreases acetyl-CoA

⑶ Conversion of OAA to PEP

> ① Enzyme: PEP Carboxykinase, located in the cytoplasm

> ② Uses 1 GTP per OAA molecule

>> ○ Glycolysis: -2 ATP, +4 ATP

>> ○ To produce one molecule of glucose: 2 GTP (OAA → PEP) + 4 ATP, a total of 6 NTPs are used

⑷ Conversion of Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to Fructose 6-phosphate

> ① Enzyme: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), located in the cytoplasm

>> ○ Enzyme for the reverse reaction: PFK-1, located in the cytoplasm

> ② Enzyme Allosteric Regulation: Inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, promoted by glucagon, inhibited by insulin

⑸ Conversion of Glucose 6-phosphate to Glucose

> ① Enzyme: Glucose-6-phosphatase, located in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum

>> ○ Enzyme for the reverse reaction: Hexokinase, located in the cytoplasm

⑹ Conversion of Glucose 6-phosphate to Glucose 1-phosphate

> ① Enzyme for the reverse reaction: Phosphoglucomutase converts G-1-P to G-6-P

⑺ Glucose 1-phosphate: Added to the 4th or 6th carbon of glycogen chain via dehydration synthesis

> ① Enzyme for the reverse reaction: Glycogen Phosphorylase breaks down glycogen to G-1-P

> ② Insulin: Promotes dephosphorylation

> ③ Glucagon: Promotes phosphorylation

⑻ Action of Insulin

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. When blood glucose levels are high, insulin binds to IR (insulin receptor)

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. This complex activates protein kinase through IRS-Pi and phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase kinase

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. PP1 (protein phosphatase 1) dephosphorylates and activates glycogen synthase

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. As a result, glycogen synthesis increases, lowering blood glucose levels

## **2\. Cori cycle**

⑴ Gluconeogenesis from lactic acid, which takes place in liver.

> ① There is no gluconeogenesis from alcohol; consider alcohol fermentation can't be observed in human.

⑵ Process

> ① The liver sends glucose to skeletal muscle.

> ② Skeletal muscle produces lactic acid.

> ③ Generated lactic acid is sent back to the liver.

> ④ Liver synthesize glucose.

⑶ When actively exercising,

> ① Skeletal muscle **:** NADH → NAD+ is so slow reaction so that  NAD+/NADH gets low.

> ② Liver **:** In liver, glycolysis normally takes place so that NAD+/NADH gets high.

## **3\. Glyoxylate acid cycle**

⑴ Definition **:** Glucose synthesis pathway of plants

⑵ Place **:** Occurs through lipid body, glyoxisome, mitochondria.
