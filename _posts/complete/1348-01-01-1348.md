## **1\. Basic Theory**

 ⑴ Electrical Work

> ① n **:** Mole number of electrons

> ② (Note) Understanding is not difficult if you know that the unit of E is V (volts) ≡ J / C

> ③ The change in Gibbs free energy associated with a process is the maximum reversible work the system can perform at constant temperature and pressure.

 ⑵ Faraday's Law of Electrolysis

> ① n **:** Molar equivalent of electrons involved in half-reaction

> ② F **:** Faraday's constant ≒ 96500 C/mol

> ③ W **:** Mass of deposited metal

> ④ M **:** Atomic equivalent of deposited metal

> ⑤ Charge of 1 mole of electrons = N₀e = 1F = 96485.33977 C/mol

>> ○ 1 F = 6.02214179 × 10²³ entities/mol × 1.602176487 × 10⁻¹⁹ C/entity = 96485.33977 C/mol

## **2. Electrochemical Cells **

 ⑴ Definitions

> ① Galvanic cell **:** An electrochemical cell that uses the potential of chemical reactions to provide voltage → spontaneous reaction

>> ○ Characteristics **:** The oxidation electrode is the cathode (-), and the reduction electrode is the anode (+).

>> ○ Galvanic cell acts as its own power source, supplying electrons from the oxidation electrode and recovering electrons at the reduction electrode.

> ② Electrolytic cell **:** Electrons move against the potential due to an external power source → electrolysis

>> ○ Characteristics **:** The reduction electrode is the cathode (-), and the oxidation electrode is the anode (+).

>> ○ An external power source (a stronger cell) is connected to the cathode to forcibly supply electrons at the reduction electrode (-).

 ⑵ Four Major Components **:** Refers to the cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator

> ① Cathode **:** The metal that receives electrons from an external wire and undergoes reduction.

> ② Anode **:** The metal that undergoes oxidation and releases electrons to an external wire.

> ③ Electrolyte **:** Substance that facilitates the movement of substances to ensure that the electrodes remain electrically neutral.

> ④ Separator **:** An insulating barrier that prevents direct physical contact between the cathode and anode.

> ⑤ Salt bridge **:** Without a salt bridge, as electrochemical reactions proceed, charges accumulate at the oxidation and reduction electrodes.

>> ○ Accumulation of charge hinders additional reactions.

>> ○ The salt bridge provides suitable ions that connect the reduction and oxidation electrodes to alleviate charge accumulation.

## **3. Galvanic Cells**

 ⑴ Standard Electrodes and Standard Potentials

> ① Reference electrode

>> ○ Necessity **:** The absolute value of electrode potential cannot be measured; only the potential difference between two electrodes can be measured.

>> ○ Condition **:** The reference electrode must exhibit ideally non-polarizable electrode characteristics.

>> ○ **Type 1:** Standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)

>>> ○ Half-cell composed of 1 atm of hydrogen gas in contact with a hydrogen ion solution with an activity of 1 at 25 ℃.

>>> ○ Platinum (Pt) is used as a simple electron conductor without participating in the reaction.

>> ○ **Type 2:** Normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)

>>> ○ Half-cell composed of 1 atm of hydrogen gas in contact with a 1 M H+ solution at 25 ℃.

>> ○ **Type 3:** Saturated calomel electrode (SCE)

>>> ○ Maintains a saturated concentration of KCl.

>>> ○ **Reason 1:** To fix the electrode potential influenced by chloride ion concentration.

>>> ○ **Reason 2:** To make the potential similar to SHE.

>> ○ **Type 4:** Silver/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl electrode)

> ② Standard Electrode Potential (E°)

>> ○ Standard reduction potential at 25 ℃ and 1 atm, with a solution concentration of 1 M in a half-cell, taking the standard hydrogen electrode as the cathode, and determining the standard reduction potential based on the reduction reaction.

>> ○ If the standard reduction potential is (+), it is easier to reduce than hydrogen ions; if (-), it is harder to reduce than hydrogen ions.

>> ○ The standard oxidation potential has the same absolute value as the standard reduction potential but with the opposite sign.

**Table 1.** Standard Reduction Potentials Table

> ③ Calculation of Standard EMF **:** Given two half-reactions, E1° for the oxidation half-reaction and E2° for the reduction half-reaction,

>> ○ Standard EMF = Reduction half-reaction's reduction potential + Oxidation half-reaction's oxidation potential = E2° - E1°

>> ○ If the standard EMF is positive, the forward reaction is spontaneous; if negative, the reverse reaction is spontaneous.

>> ○ **Tip:** Complex electrode problems can be solved by considering adjacent oxidation and reduction half-reactions as a single cell.

>> ○ ΔG° < 0 ⇔ E° > 0 ⇔ K > 1

>> ○ ΔG° < 0 ⇔ E° < 0 ⇔ K < 1

> ④ Eeq and E°

>> ○ Nernst equation can also be applied to half-cells

>> ○ Considering the form An+ + ne- → A, where the degree of freedom of electrons is 1 and Q = [A] / [An+],

>> ○ Prediction of oxidation/reduction tendencies for two half-cells based on Eeq and E° is different: Eeq must be followed.

>> ○ Example: For [Fe2+] = [Fe3+] = 0.1 M and [Ag+] = 10⁻⁵ M, the Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ half-cell undergoes reduction, and the Ag/Ag⁺ half-cell undergoes oxidation.

>> ○ **Example 2:** Voltage Difference as Intensive Property: Subtract oxidation electrode potential from reduction electrode potential

>>> Zn(_s_) + Cu²⁺(_aq_) → Zn²⁺(_aq_) + Cu(_s_), ΔG = -212 kJ, Ecellº = +1.10 eV

>>> 2Zn(_s_) + 2Cu²⁺(_aq_) → 2Zn²⁺(_aq_) + 2Cu(_s_), ΔG = -424 kJ, Ecellº = +1.10 eV

> ② Reaction within Electrodes

>> ○ **Example 1.** **Latimer Diagram** **:** Calculation of reduction potentials in electrode reactions similar to the internal division formula in mathematics.

>> ○ **Example 2.** When ligands form complexes

>>> ○ **Phenomenon 1.** As complex formation between metal ions and ligands increases (larger Kf), E°complex becomes more negative.

>>> ○ **Phenomenon 2.** As complex formation between metal ions and ligands increases, the potential decreases.

>>> ○ **Phenomenon 2** and its relation to the decrease in [Au3+] leads to a decrease in the value of E = E° - (0.0592 / n) × log (1 / [Au3+]).

>>> ○ Note that the situation with E° = 1.50 V and Ecomplex° = 1.00 V is not the same.

> ② Capacity of Practical Batteries (ampere-hour rating)

>> ○ Since the voltage of each chemical cell is constant, it is expressed in terms of current (unit: Ah, mAh).

>> ○ Battery lifespan

>> ○ The capacity of chemical cells decreases with higher current and decreases at temperatures higher or lower than room temperature (24 ℃ = 75.2 ℉).

>> ○ Alkaline conditions

> ③ Memorizing the electrolysis reactions of water is unnecessary; understanding them is important [Reference](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1604)

> ④ In reality, there's a potential drop across the two electrodes, considering overpotential is necessary.

>> ○ Reaction Example

>> ○ Electrolysis occurs when slightly more than 1.23 V is applied, exceeding the potential.

 ⑵ Electrolysis of Solutions

>> ○ Decomposition reaction of sodium chloride and water

>> ○ Anode Reaction **:** Oxidation potential is high for water or hydroxide ions, but chlorine ions oxidize due to practical reasons.

>>> ○ Practical reasons **:** Reaction rate factors, experimental factors (e.g., overpotential)

>> ○ Cathode Reaction **:** Reduction potential for hydrogen ions is higher than that of sodium ions, so hydrogen ions are reduced.

> ② Electrolysis of Copper Sulfate (CuSO4) Solution

>> ○ Decomposition reaction of copper sulfate and water

>> ○ Anode Reaction **:** Sulfate ions are difficult to oxidize, so hydroxide ions are oxidized.

>> ○ Cathode Reaction **:** Copper ions readily accept electrons compared to hydrogen ions.

> ③ Corrosion **:** Undesired oxidation of metals

**Figure 2.** Corrosion of iron

>> ○ Reaction equations

>>> ○ Reduction of water 1.

>>>> 2H2O(ℓ) + 2e- → H2(g) + 2OH-(aq), Eº = -0.83 V

>>> ○ Reduction of water 2.

>>>> O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e- → 2H2O(ℓ), PO2 = 0.2 bar, Eº = 1.23 V

>>> ○ Oxidation of iron 1.

>>>> Fe2+(aq) + 2e- → Fe, Eº = -0.44 V

>>> ○ Oxidation of iron 2.

>>>> Fe3+ \+ e- → Fe2+, Eº = 0.77 V

>> ○ Anaerobic conditions

>>> ○ Reduction of water 2 doesn't occur

>>> ○ At pH = 7, reduction of water 1 is E = -0.42 V

>>> ○ The potential difference between -0.42 V and -0.44 V is only 0.02 V, so corrosion of iron doesn't occur vigorously.

>> ○ Aerobic conditions

>>> ○ Reduction of water 2 occurs more readily than reduction of water 1

>>> ○ 1.23 V is greater than -0.44 V and 0.77 V, so both oxidation reactions of iron 1 and 2 occur

>>> ○ Corrosion of iron occurs vigorously, resulting in Fe3+ oxidation

>> ○ **Application 1.** Corrosion generally takes a long time

>> ○ **Application 2.** Measures to prevent corrosion

>>> ○ Coating: Applying paint as a coating

>>> ○ Galvanization: Plating with a metal that ionizes easily (the plated metal oxidizes instead, extending the time)

>>> ○ Sacrificial anode (cathodic protection)
