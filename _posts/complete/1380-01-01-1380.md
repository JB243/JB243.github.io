## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Common Reaction Principles

> ① Nucleophilic Attack, Electrophilic Attack

> ② Proton Transfer: Occurs intermolecularly between molecules rather than intramolecularly within a molecule

> ③ Tautomerization: Enol ↔ Ketone

> ④ Work-up: Precise identification of the base is not necessary

⑵ Properties

> ① Physical Properties

>> ○ Carboxylic acids stabilize in dimeric forms due to hydrogen bonding

>> ○ The dimeric structure results in carboxylic acids producing infrared absorption spectra around 2500-3000 cm<sup>-1</sup>

> ② Comparison of Carbonyl Compound Reactivities

>> ○ **acyl halide** ＞ acid anhydride ＞ aldehyde ＞ ketone ＞ ester ~ carboxylic acid＞ amide ＞ carboxylate ion

⑶ Carbonyl Compound Reaction Types

> ① **Type 1:** When the nucleophilicity of Y<sup>-</sup> is greater than that of X<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ **Type 1** is frequently observed in acyl chlorides

>> ○ Carboxylic acids and others also exhibit a similar prevalence of **Type 1**

>> ○ Aldehydes and ketones rarely undergo reactions of **Type 1**

**Figure 1.** Carbonyl Compound Reaction **Type 1**

<br>

> ② **Type 2:** When the nucleophilicity of Y<sup>-</sup> is smaller than that of X<sup>-</sup>

>> ○ Most aldehydes and ketones follow **Type 2**

>> ○ Even other reactions often seem to be merely an application of **Type 2**.

## **2\. Carboxylic Acids**

 ⑴ Nomenclature

> ① Replace the -e of the alkane with -oic acid for naming

> ② Systemic nomenclature: Carbon number 1 becomes the carbon of -COOH

> ③ Common nomenclature: Adjacent carbon to -COOH becomes the α carbon

> ④ If there are alkenes, alkynes, etc., in the main chain, alkanoic acid becomes alkenoic acid, alkynoic acid, etc.

**Figure 7.** Reaction for Generating phtaloyl chloride from phthalic acid

<br>

> ② **Reaction 1-2:** Fischer Esterification

>> ○ **(Formula)** RCO**OH** + **H**OR' react under acidic conditions to form RCOOR' + **H<sub>2</sub>O**

>> ○ Carboxylic acids do not undergo acetal formation reactions, so they do not compete with Fischer esterification.

>> ○ The reason that proton attaches to =O rather than -OH under acidic catalysis

>>> ○ Assumption: ROH must form a tetrahedral intermediate with carboxylic acid to facilitate the departure of the leaving group

>>> ○ Proton attaching to -OH: ROH results in =O becoming -O<sup>-</sup> and -OH becoming -OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, making the molecule unstable

>>> ○ Proton attaching to =O: ROH results in =OH<sup>+</sup> becoming -OH, and the original -OH remains unchanged, stabilizing the intermediate

**Figure 8.** Fischer Esterification Mechanism

<br>

>> ○ Under basic catalysis, only the acid-base reaction occurs, converting -COOH to -COO<sup>-</sup>

**Figure 10.** EDC/NHS Coupling

<br>

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. EDC reacts with the carboxyl group of the target molecule

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. NHS stabilizes the EDC intermediate: Because the EDC intermediate can react with water

>>>> ○ In other words, NHS prevents extensive reaction with water, promoting rapid amine reaction

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Amines are attached to form amide bonds

>>> ○ Additional Notes

>>>> ○ Generally, protocols indicate that EDC and NHS are added simultaneously to the target molecule solution.

>>>> ○ Adding NHS first does not cause it to react with the target molecule

>>> ○ NHS (_N_-hydroxysuccinimide) Supplementation

>>>> ○ NHS is the most frequently used activated ester

>>>> ○ NHS-amine labeling is usually done in water as a solvent

>>>> ○ Since NHS decreases water solubility, DMSO or DMF is sometimes added.

>>>> ○ For reactions where water solubility is crucial, sulfo NHS is used

>> ○ **Point 2:** Difference between EDC and DCC: EDC and DCC perform similar roles overall

>>> ○ EDC: Generates a water-soluble byproduct (urea byproduct) within 1 day

>>> ○ DCC: Performs the role of EDC in organic solvents, forming DCU

>> ○ **Point 3:** Various Application Cases
