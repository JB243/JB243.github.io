## **1\. Sign Test** 

 ⑴ Overview

> ① A test method that uses only the sign of the difference, ignoring the magnitude of the difference, to test the position of the median

> ② Convert the data into signs of + and - based on the median, and then test based on the number of these signs

> ③ Assumes that the data distribution is continuous and independent

 ⑵ Procedure

> ① **Step 1.** Sample extraction

>> ○ Extract a continuous sample from the population

>> ○ Define the remaining samples as X1, X2, ..., Xn when the number of samples remaining after excluding samples equal to the assumed median θ0 is n

> ② **Step 2.** Test statistic

> ③ **Step 3.** Rejection region for significance level α

>> ○ Null hypothesis **:** θ = θ<sub>0</sub>

>> ○ If the alternative hypothesis is θ ＞ θ<sub>0</sub>, then the rejection region is B ≥ b(α, n, 1/2)

>> ○ If the alternative hypothesis is θ ＜ θ<sub>0</sub>, then the rejection region is B ≤ b(α, n, 1/2)

>> ○ If the alternative hypothesis is θ ≠ θ<sub>0</sub>, then the rejection region is B ≥ b(α/2, n, 1/2) or B ＜ b(1 - α/2, b, 1/2)

## **2\. ROC Analysis** (receiver operator characteristic)

 ⑴ Parameter Definition

> ① TP (true positive) **:** The case where the actual value is true and the measured value is true. (Note) Means real positive

> ② FN (false negative) **:** The case where the actual value is true and the measured value is false. (Note) Means fake negative

> ③ FP (false positive) **:** The case where the actual value is false and the measured value is true. (Note) Means fake positive

> ④ TN (true negative) **:** The case where the actual value is false and the measured value is false. (Note) Means real negative

> ⑤ **Sensitivity** (true positive rate, TPR) or Recall **:** TP / (TP + FN)

> ⑥ **Specificity** **:** TN / (TN + FP)

> ⑦ Accuracy **:** (TP + TN) / (TP + FN + FP + TN)

> ⑧ Error rate **:** 1 - Accuracy

> ⑨ **Precision** or Positive Predictive Value (PPV) **:** TP / (TP + FP)

> ⑨ Negative Predictive Value (NPV) **:** TN / (TN + FN)

> ⑩ **False Discovery Rate** (FDR, false positive rate) **:** FP / (TN + FP)

> ⑪ F1 Score **:** 2 × precision × recall / (precision + recall)

>> ○ A performance evaluation indicator that combines precision and sensitivity

>> ○ Ranges from 0 to 1

>> ○ The higher the precision and sensitivity, the higher the F1 Score

> ⑫ Kappa Statistic

>> ○ K = (Pr(a) - Pr(e)) / (1 - Pr(e))

>> ○ K **:** Kappa coefficient

>> ○ Pr(a) **:** Probability of prediction being accurate

>> ○ Pr(e) **:** Probability of prediction being coincidentally accurate

>> ○ A method to measure the agreement of categorical values measured by two observers

>> ○ Ranges from 0 to 1, with closer to 1 indicating better agreement between model predictions and actual values, and closer to 0 indicating disagreement

>> ○ In addition to accuracy, the kappa statistic is used to demonstrate that the evaluation results of the model are not coincidental

 ⑵ Concordance Index

> ① Generally, adjusting the threshold causes sensitivity and specificity to show opposite trends

>> ○ The ideal case is when both sensitivity and specificity are 1

> ③ Concordance Index **:** Refers to the area under the AOC curve

> ④ If the ROC is random, the concordance index = 0.5

> ⑤ The concordance cannot exceed 1
