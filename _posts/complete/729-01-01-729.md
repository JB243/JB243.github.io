## **1\. Definition of Work**

 ⑴ Work **:** Magnitude of applied force × Distance moved in the direction of applied force

 ⑵ Unit **:** N·m = kg·m2 / s2 = J

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Energy**

 ⑴ The ability to do work

 ⑵ Mechanical energy (E) = Potential energy (EP) + Kinetic energy (EK)

 ⑶ Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy **:** If only conservative forces (e.g., friction, air resistance) act and non-conservative forces are absent, mechanical energy remains constant between initial and final states

 ⑷ Law of Conservation of Energy

> ① Through the equivalence of heat and work, it is shown that thermal energy is not significantly different from mechanical energy

> ② Bernoulli's principle

>> ○ Content **:** For every symmetry in nature, there is a corresponding conservation law

>> ○ The universe has symmetry with respect to time

>> ○ The corresponding conservation quantity is considered to be energy

## **3\. Kinetic Energy**

 ⑴ From the kinematic equation 2as = v2 \- v02, if we multiply by mass (m), we get mas = 0.5mv2 \- 0.5mv02

 ⑵ Therefore, as F = ma, the change in work is 0.5 mv2 \- 0.5mv02, so if v0 = 0, kinetic energy is 0.5 mv2

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Potential Energy due to Gravity**

 ⑴ The magnitude of gravity is mg, and the displacement is h, so the potential energy due to gravity during displacement is mgh

 ⑵ Potential energy is a relative value and can vary depending on the reference point even at the same position

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Potential Energy due to Elasticity**

 ⑴ Elastic force is not constant when the length changes; it's proportional to the change in length, so the average elastic force acting over an elongation of x units from the original position is 0.5 kx

 ⑵ Therefore, the potential energy due to elastic force at x is 0.5 kx × x = 0.5 kx2

> ① Integration can be applied

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Potential Energy due to Universal Gravitation**

 ⑴ Potential energy due to universal gravitation at a position R from the center

<br>

<br>

## **7\. Power**

 ⑴ Work per unit time P = W/t

 ⑵ Unit **:** N·m/s = W

 ⑶ P = W / t = F · S / t = F · v
