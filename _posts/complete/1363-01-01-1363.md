## **1. Overview**

 ⑴ Structure

> ① Structure of Alkene

>> ○ Double Bond = 1 × σ bond + 1 × π bond

>> ○ Double bond carbons are sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized

>> ○ Trigonal planar

>> ○ All bond angles are 120°

>> ○ High s-character leads to shorter bond lengths

> ② Structure of Alkyne

>> ○ Triple Bond = 1 × σ bond + 2 × π bonds

>> ○ Triple bond carbons are sp hybridized

>> ○ Linear

>> ○ All bond angles are 180°

>> ○ Highest s-character leads to shortest bond lengths

⑵ Bonding

> ① Bond Energies of Alkane, Alkene, and Alkyne

>> ○ Alkane: CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub>, 368 kJ/mol

>> ○ Alkene: CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>, 635 kJ/mol

>> ○ Alkyne: CH≡CH, 837 kJ/mol

> ② Bond Energies of σ Bond, First π Bond, Second π Bond

>> ○ σ bond: 368 kJ/mol

>> ○ First π bond: 635 - 368 = 267 kJ/mol

>> ○ Second π bond: 837 - 635 = 202 kJ/mol

>> ○ π bonds have [nodes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1334#1-orbital-atomic-model) unlike σ bonds, making them weaker in strength

>> ○ Alkynes have loosely held π bonding electrons, leading to higher polarity than alkenes

> ③ Summary of Bond Energies

<br>

| Hybridization | Bond | Bonding Energy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-C(sp<sup>3</sup>) | Sigma bond | 85 kcal/mol |
| C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-C(sp<sup>2</sup>) | Sigma bond | 90 kcal/mol |
| C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-H(s) | Sigma bond | 100 kcal/mol |
| C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-H(s) | Sigma bond | 105 kcal/mol |
| C(p)-C(p) | Pi bond | 60 kcal/mol |
| C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-C(sp<sup>3</sup>) | Semi-pi bond | 45 kcal/mol |

**Table 1.** Summary of Bond Energies

<br>

> ④ Bond Lengths: Single bond > Double bond > Triple bond

>> ○ Single bond: sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized, Double bond: sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized, Triple bond: sp hybridized

>> ○ As one moves from a single bond to a triple bond, the s-character increases, causing the electrons to stay closer to the nucleus, resulting in a shorter bond length.

⑶ Properties

> ① Boiling Point

>> ○ **Principle 1.** Generally, longer chain length and larger surface area lead to higher boiling points, similar to alkanes

>> ○ **Principle 2.** Higher dipole moment leads to higher boiling point

>>> _○ cis_ alkenes have higher dipole moments compared to _trans_ alkenes, resulting in higher boiling points

>>>> ○ Example: Boiling point of _cis_-2-butene is 4°C, while _trans_-2-butene is 1°C

>>> ○ Exception: _trans_-2-hexene has a higher boiling point than _cis_-2-hexene

>>>> ○ Reason: Van der Waals forces. Evaluation needs to be done on a case-by-case basis

>> ○ **Principle 3.** Alkynes have higher boiling points than structurally similar alkenes

>>> ○ **Reason 1.** Alkenes have a trigonal planar geometry, while alkynes are linear, favoring better intermolecular interactions in alkynes

>>> ○ **Reason 2.** The sp carbon in alkynes is more electronegative than the sp2 carbon in alkenes, leading to greater polarity

>>> ○ **Reason 3.** The strength of pi bonding in triple bonds is weaker than in alkenes, promoting greater polarization and increasing van der Waals forces.

>> ○ **Principle 4.** Internal alkenes and alkynes have higher boiling points than terminal ones

>>> ○ Reason: Because terminal alkenes and alkynes are highly hydrophobic.

> ② Melting Point

>> ○ **Principle 1.** Longer chain length and larger surface area lead to higher melting points, similar to alkanes

>> ○ **Principle 2.** Higher lattice (symmetry) leads to higher melting points: note the difference in trend compared to boiling points

>>> ○ _trans_ alkenes can form crystal lattices compared to _cis_ alkenes, resulting in higher melting points

>>> ○ Example: Melting point of _cis_-2-butene is -139°C, while _trans_-2-butene is -106°C

>>> ○ Example: Melting point of n-hexane is higher than (E)-hex-2-ene

> ③ Unlike single bonds, rotation is restricted in double and triple bonds

>> ○ Cycloalkanes have reduced degrees of freedom, leading to easy intermolecular interactions, resulting in higher boiling and melting points

⑷ Stability

> ① **Method 1.** Hydrogenation Reaction Enthalpy

>> ○ Heat released by adding hydrogen maximally, higher heat release indicates a less stable form

>> ○ Used frequently to assess stability of compounds with multiple bonds due to its precision

> ② **Method 2.** Heat of Combustion per Carbon

>> ○ Stability is inversely proportional to the heat of combustion per carbon

> ③ Substituent Count: More substituents lead to greater stability in alkenes

>> ○ **Complex Explanation:** Interaction between anti-π (π*) bonding orbitals and adjacent σ orbitals due to hyperconjugation

>> ○ **Simplified Explanation:** Double bond carbons are sp2 hybridized, with 33% s-character, while substituent carbons are sp3 hybridized with 25% s-character, leading to substituent carbons having an affinity to donate electrons, and central carbons having an affinity to accept electrons

>> ○ **Even Simpler Explanation:** Alkenes are more electronegative → they become stable by receiving electrons from substituents

> ④ _cis_-_trans_ Stability Difference

>> ○ Linear Alkenes: <i>trans</i> is more stable than <i>cis</i> due to steric hindrance.

>> ○ [Cyclic Alkenes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1412)

>>> ○ Cyclooctene [8] ~ Cycloundecene [11]: _cis_ is more stable than _trans_

>>>> ○ **Reason 1:** _trans_ alkenes adopt twisted conformations, leading to increased ring strain

>>>> ○ **Reason 2:** _trans_ alkenes have hydrogen atoms within the ring, causing significant steric hindrance

>>> ○ Cyclododecene [12]: Similar stability for cis and trans structures

>>> ○ Cyclotridecene [13]: trans structure is more stable than cis

## 2. [Nomenclature of Linear Alkenes and Alkynes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357) 

⑴ Selection of Main Chain

> ① Assuming functional groups are alkyl, halogen, alkene, and alkyne

> ② Alkenes and alkynes take priority over alkanes, so the longest carbon chain containing alkene or alkyne determines the main chain, and the rest are considered substituents

⑵ Naming Substituents

> ① Alkyl and halogen group nomenclature is the same as for alkanes

> ② For chain and cyclic alkenes and alkynes functioning as substituents, change -ene and -yne suffixes to -enyl and -ynyl

>> ○ In this case, the nearest carbon to the substituent on the main chain is assigned as carbon 1

⑶ Numbering

> ① Sequentially assign numbers from one end of the main chain to the other

> ② Alkenes and alkynes take precedence over substituents, so assign lower numbers to them

>> ○ The position of a multiple bond is indicated by the first carbon where the multiple bond begins.

>> ○ Example: 4-methyl-2-pentene

> ③ When two numbering combinations are possible, assign numbers so that the alkene or alkyne has the lower number.

> ④ If numbers are the same, select the combination where the alkene (alk _e_ ne) comes before the alkyne (alk _y_ ne) based on alphabetical order

>> ○ Example: 1-penten-4-yne

> ⑤ When both numbering combinations are still possible after ④ and there's a single substituent, assign the lowest number to the carbon bearing the substituent

> ⑥ When both numbering combinations are still possible after ④ and there are multiple substituents, assign the lowest number to the carbon(s) bearing the substituents

> ⑦ If numbers are still the same after ⑥, assign the lower number to the substituent in alphabetical order

⑷ Suffix Naming

> ① When there's only one alkene: Name as 《··· + alkene position-ene》

> ② When there's only one alkyne: Name as 《··· + alkyne position-yne》

> ③ When there's one alkene and one alkyne: Name as 《··· + alkene position-en-alkyne position-yne》

> ④ When there are multiple alkenes or alkynes

>> ○ Alkenes: Change -ene to -diene(2), -triene(3), -tetraene(4), etc. based on the number of alkenes

>>> ○ Example: 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene

>> ○ Alkynes: Change -yne to -diyne(2), -triyne(3), -tetrayne(4), etc. based on the number of alkynes

⑸ Full Name Nomenclature

> ① Name as 《(substituent position-substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + alk-alkene-alkyne position-suffix》

> ② For main chain ( _alk_ ), usually end with a consonant; however, if consonant conflict occurs, leave -a

>> ○ Example: hept-1-ene doesn't end with -a, but hexa-1,3-diene ends with -a.

<br>

<br>

## 3. [Nomenclature of Cyclic Alkenes and Alkynes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1357)

⑴ Selection of Main Chain

> ① If the cyclic alkene or alkyne has an alkane substituent: Priority given to alkene/alkyne, making the cyclic compound the main chain

> ② If a chain alkene or alkyne is substituent on a cyclic alkene or alkyne (to be updated later)

⑵ Naming Substituents

> ① Alkyl and halogen groups are named the same as for alkanes

> ② For chain and cyclic alkenes and alkynes functioning as substituents, change -ene and -yne suffixes to -enyl and -ynyl

>> ○ In this case, the nearest carbon to the substituent on the main chain is assigned as carbon 1

⑶ Numbering

> ① Assign numbers so that alkene/alkyne is positioned between carbon 1 and carbon 2 of the main chain.

> ② If multiple alkenes/alkynes are present, assign numbers to minimize the numbers while not violating ①

> ③ If numbers are the same, select the combination with the lower-numbered alkene before alkyne based on alphabetical order

> ④ If two numbering combinations are still possible (clockwise, counterclockwise) and substituents are attached to only one alkene/alkyne carbon, designate that carbon as carbon 1

>> ○ Example: 3-ethyl-2-methyl-cyclopent-1-ene (×), 5-ethyl-1-methylcyclopent-1-ene (○)

> ⑤ If two numbering combinations are still possible and not covered by ④, assign numbers to minimize the carbon bearing the substituent

>> ○ If not covered by ④: When substituents are present or absent on all alkene/alkyne carbons

⑷ Suffix Naming: Same as **2**-⑷

> ① Example: 5-methyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene

⑸ Full Name Nomenclature

> ① Name as 《(substituent position-substituent name)<sub>n</sub> + cycloalk-alkene-alkyne position-suffix》

<br>

## **4\. Electrophilic Reactions of Alkenes**

⑴ Overview

> ① The nature of the reagent is electrophilic, and the reactant causing addition reactions is nucleophilic.

> ② Generally, addition reactions are exothermic and ΔG ≒ ΔH, so they are spontaneous due to thermodynamics.

> ③ **Type 1:** Halogen compounds: Halogenation of hydrogen, halogen addition reaction, formation of halohydrins.

> ④ **Type 2:** Hydration reactions: Acid-catalyzed hydration, oxymercuration-demercuration, hydroboration-induced hydration.

> ⑤ **Type 3:** Carbonyl compounds: Carbonyl addition reaction.

> ⑥ **Type 4:** Hydrogenation: Pd/C hydrogenation reaction, Pt/O2 hydrogenation reaction.

> ⑦ **Type 5:** Oxidation reactions: Epoxidation, 1,2-dihydroxylation, oxidative cleavage by KMnO4, ozonolysis.

> ⑧ **Type 6:** Other reactions.

> ⑨ **Key Points**

>> ○ Position selectivity (Markovnikov's rule): Selectivity of structural isomers.

>> ○ Stereoselectivity (_syn_, _anti_ addition): Selectivity of stereoisomers.

>> ○ Racemization.

>> ○ Ring formation reactions.

⑵ **1-1.** Halogenation of Hydrogen Addition Reaction

> ① **(Formula)** Attach H+ to a carbon with more hydrogens, rearrange positions, and then add X-  or proceed with intramolecular S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.

> ② Mechanism

**Figure 1.** Electrophilic Substitution Reaction

<br>

>> ○ **Carbocation**: Rate-determining step is the first step, racemization, rearrangement, electron-donating resonance effect, hyperconjugation.

>>> ○ More alkyl groups on carbocation result in more stability due to electron-donating resonance effect, hyperconjugation.

>> ○ X<sup>-</sup> can attack from either the front or back side, allowing racemization.

>>> ○ Significance: Reaction of achiral molecules leading to achiral intermediates and chiral products.

>> ○ In the transition state of the first step, hydrogen forms two bonds (C-H, H-X).

> ③ Markovnikov's rule

<br>

**Figure 2.** Markovnikov's Rule

<br>

>> ○ Description: The hydrogen of H-X adds to the carbon with more hydrogens in the alkene's double bond, forming the major product.

>> ○ The 3° carbocation on the left is more stable than the 2° carbocation on the right (**∵** more substituents).

>> ○ The pathway through the 3° carbocation has a lower activation energy, favoring the major product formation.

> ④ Markovnikov's Rule Exception: Rearrangement Reaction

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/79d0aecb-8357-4bd1-92f3-ffd26b5c37ff)

**Figure 3.** Markovnikov Exception

<br>

>> ○ Types: 1,2-hydride shift, 1,2-methyl shift.

>> ○ Cause: Due to hyperconjugation.

>> ○ Rearrangement occurs due to hyperconjugation, and the path through the 3° carbocation generates the major product.

>> ○ While Markovnikov's rule doesn't always apply, the formation of a more stable intermediate leading to the major product is invariant.

> ⑤ 1,2-Addition, 1,4-Addition: Illustrated with 1,3-butadiene

>> ○ Mechanism of 1,2-addition and 1,4-addition

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/159a6153-23f1-4499-a6f5-72dd78aab175)

**Figure 4.** Halogenation of Hydrogen Addition Reaction in 1,3-butadiene

<br>

>> ○ At 0°C, 1,2-addition: 1,4-addition = 71:29.

>> ○ At 40°C, 1,2-addition: 1,4-addition = 15:85.

>> ○ 1,2-addition: Kinetic product, favored at lower temperatures due to stable 1,2-addition via carbocation.

>> ○ 1,4-addition: Thermodynamic product, favored at higher temperatures; reverse reaction occurs, so thermodynamically stable 1,4-addition prevails.

⑶ **1-2.** Halogenation Addition Reaction: _anti_ Addition

> ① **(Formula)** Add X<sup>+</sup> considering steric hindrance, then _anti_ addition of X<sup>-</sup>.

>> ○ In the halonium ring intermediate of an asymmetrical alkene, the carbon atom with more substituents, as well as the halogen atom, carries partial positive charge.

>> ○ Carbon with more substituents is partially positively charged due to **S<sub>N</sub>1-like reaction.**

>> ○ X<sup>-</sup> attacks on carbons with multiple substituents.

> ② Mechanism

>> ○ X-X is polarized, with one side having δ+ charge and the other side having δ<sup>-</sup> charge.

>> ○ X<sup>-</sup> can exist independently in a stable manner.

>> ○ Mechanism of halogenation in linear alkenes

**Figure 6.** Halogenation Addition Reaction Mechanism in Cyclic Alkenes

<br>

> ③ Halonium ring intermediate

>> ○ Due to instability of the halonium ring intermediate, other paths are chosen if available.

>> ○ In the case of unsymmetrical reagents, the reaction occurs to stabilize the halonium ring intermediate.

>> ○ In the case of halogenation of hydrogen addition reaction, the limited number of hydrogen orbitals (2) prevents the formation of a ring intermediate.

>> ○ The reason halogen addition reactions occur with alkenes before alkynes is that the halonium ring intermediate of an alkyne is too unstable.

> ④ Stereochemistry

>> ○ Backside attack: X<sup>-</sup> proceeds with a backside attack due to steric hindrance.

>>> ○ However, _anti_-addition and _syn_-addition are possible.

>> ○ Mesocompounds or racemic mixtures can form, but one side can be favored due to steric hindrance.

>> ○ Halogenation of cyclohexene

>>> ○ Due to the ring intermediate, the stable conformation of cyclohexene is boat-form, leading to unexpected outcomes in steric hindrance and major product.

>>> ○ Incorrect intuition

**Figure 7.** Incorrect Intuition

<br>

>>> ○ Correct approach

**Figure 8.** Correct Approach

<br>

⑷ **1-3.** Formation of Halohydrins

> ① **(Formula)** Similar to halogen addition reaction: Attach X<sup>+</sup> first, then _anti_ addition of OH.

> ② Mechanism

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/2b18d4de-ed46-4b65-92d6-1bcf27d4a897)

**Figure 9.** Formation of Halohydrins Reaction

<br>

>> ○ Since HX is a stronger acid than H<sub>2</sub>O, X<sup>-</sup> is less basic than OH<sup>-</sup>, so water adds if present.

>> ○ In the halonium ring intermediate of an asymmetrical alkene, the carbon atom with more substituents, as well as the halogen atom, carries partial positive charge.

>> ○ Carbon atoms with more substituents are partially positively charged due to **S<sub>N</sub>1-like reaction.**

>> ○ OH adds to partially positively charged carbon atoms.

>> ○ NBS can be used as the source of Br<sub>2</sub> similarly to NIS for I<sub>2</sub>.

⑸ **2-1.** Acid-Catalyzed Hydration: Markovnikov Hydration

> ① Characteristics

>> ○ Since OH<sup>-</sup> is not a good leaving group, the following reaction may be thermodynamically possible but cannot occur kinetically.

>> ○ Acid catalyst (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>): H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> acts both as a reactant (electrophile) and as a product, which makes it appear as though the acid is a catalyst.

**Figure 11.** Correct Mechanism for Acid-Catalyzed Hydration

<br>

> ② **(Formula)** Attach H<sup>+</sup> to carbon with more hydrogens, consider carbocation rearrangement and ring closure.

>> ○ **Carbocation**: Rate-determining step is the first step, racemization, rearrangement, electron-donating resonance effect, hyperconjugation.

> ③ If an alkene and -OH group coexist within one molecule, the alkene reacts first.

>> ○ The [E1 reaction of alcohols](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1372#3-reactions) proceeds through an oxonium ion intermediate.

⑹ **2-2.** Oxymercuration-Demercuration

> ① **(Formula)** Attach H<sup>+</sup> to carbon with more hydrogens, add -OH: -OH comes from H<sub>2</sub>O, and H comes from NaBH<sub>4</sub>.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/3d708402-f1a1-42ed-8864-6c16d7beb726)

**Figure 13.** Oxymercuration Reaction Mechanism

<br>

>>> ○ **1-1.** HgOAc<sup>+</sup> acts as a Lewis acid.

>>> ○ **1-2.** Pi electrons of alkene donate to mercury cation, forming mercury-bridged carbocation.

>>> ○ **1-3.** The mercury-bridged carbocation possesses a positive charge that doesn't cause rearrangement.

>> ○ When in the carbocation state, having more alkyl groups stabilizes the carbon. Therefore, the carbon with more alkyl groups carries a partial positive charge in this reaction.

>> ○ Major product is formed when nucleophile attacks carbon with more substituents.

>> ○ Reaction resembles S<sub>N</sub>2 but also exhibits characteristics of S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction.

> ③ **2nd Step:** Demercuration (Demercuration)

> ⑤ Stereoselectivity and Stereospecificity

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/be013b31-8d97-4ecb-9d89-4cf2782f1f09)

**Figure 15.** Stereoselectivity and Stereospecificity in Oxymercuration-Demercuration

<br>

>> ○ Stereoselectivity: -OH adds to the side with more substituents because the more substituted carbon bears a stronger δ<sup>+</sup> charge.

>> ○ Stereospecificity: -OH is axial due to proximity to 1,3-diaxial interactions and the _t_-Bu group, while the opposite side only experiences the influence of distant 1,3-diaxial interactions.

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/9557bea5-c375-4a8f-8a39-f30869aa018a)

**Figure 16.** Reason for the Stereospecificity of 1-methyl-4-_tert_-butylcyclohexene

<br>

> ⑥ Other Reaction Variations

>> ○ If ROH is provided instead of H<sub>2</sub>O in the 1<sup>st</sup> step, -OR substitutes for -OH.

>> ○ If NaBD<sub>4</sub> is used instead of NaBH<sub>4</sub> in the 2<sup>nd</sup> step, -H substitutes for -D.

>> ○ When NaBH<sub>4</sub> and NaBD<sub>4</sub> compete, NaBH4 reacts first: (Mnemonic tip) Deuterium D is heavier, so its reaction occurs more slowly.

>> ○ Hg(O<sub>2</sub>CCF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> can be used instead of Hg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>: The latter is more electrophilic.

⑺ **2-3.** Hydroboration-Oxidation Reaction

> ① Role of THF: Stabilizes BH<sub>3</sub> in solution.

>> ○ Reaction equation: B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (diborane) + 2 THF → 2 BH<sub>3</sub>:THF

> ② **(Formula)** The conditions 1. BH<sub>3</sub>, THF; 2. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, OH<sup>-</sup> involve <i>syn</i> addition of -OH and -H, considering H<sub>2</sub>B-H analogous to HO-H.

>> ○ Reacts with electron-rich alkenes, forms rings to prevent carbocation formation from donating alkene carbons

>> ○ Carbenes avoid reacting with alkynes if a ring forms due to double bond strain

>> ○ Carbene and peroxy acids prefer electron-rich multisubstituted alkenes.

>> ○ Carbene singlet undergoes concerted reactions, thus showing _syn_ addition

>> ○ Carbene triplet doesn't undergo concerted reactions, yielding two different products

**Figure 25.** Hydrogenation reaction example

<br>

> ③ Reactivity

>> ○ Alkene selectivity in hydrogenation reactions: The fewer the substituents, the faster the reaction rate (due to substituents being proportional to steric hindrance).
  
>> ○ The higher the electron density on the alkene, the faster the rate of reduction reactions: Electron-donating substituents increase the reaction rate when substituted.

>> ○ Generally, hydrogenation reactions catalyzed by palladium do not reduce aromatic rings or ester functional groups.

>> ○ When both an alkene and a ketone are present, the alkene is hydrogenated first (because the reactivity of the alkene is greater).

>> ○ Under conditions of excess hydrogen and high temperature and pressure, carbonyl groups can also be reduced.

<br>

>> ○ In reality, it doesn't go through a vinyl carbocation.

>>> ○ Resultantly equivalent, depicted as shown above.

>>> ○ In reality, hydrogen forms a weak bridge with the two alkene carbons.

>> ○ In step 2, the carbocation forms on the carbon with X<sup>-</sup> due to resonance stabilization.

>> ○ Since it's a carbocation, X<sup>-</sup> can approach from any direction.

> ② **Carbocation**: First step is rate-determining, racemization, rearrangement, electron-donating effect, hyperconjugation

> ③ **Resonance Stabilization**: In rearrangement, the carbocation moves toward the carbon with X<sup>-</sup> even if the carbon with X<sup>-</sup> is less substituted.

> ④ Stereoechemistry

>> ○ In the addition of 1 equivalent of HX, trans product is preferred.

>> ○ When X<sup>-</sup> ion is in excess with HX, the yield of trans-oriented product increases.

<br>

> ① In the halogen addition reaction in alkynes, the generated halonium ring intermediate has a double bond and is quite unstable.

**Figure 41.** Halo Hydrin Reaction

<br>

> ② Unsymmetrical alkynes: After the formation of the halonium ion, when the nucleophilic water attacks, it attacks the carbon that holds more carbocation character, determined by the direction of the stereogenic center.

⑸ **2.** Hydration Reaction

> ① Enol and Keto Forms

>> ○ Enol form: Structure with a double bond and an alcohol group, i.e., R2C=C(OH)R

>> ○ Keto form: Structure with a carbonyl group (or aldehyde group), i.e., R2HC-CO-R

>> ○ Tautomerization: Equilibrium reaction between enol and keto forms

>> ○ π bonding: C=O bond is much stronger than C=C bond, favoring the keto form, making enol unstable

>> ○ **Exception 1.** 4-aminopyridine undergoes tautomeric reactions; as the amine group is basic, enol-like form is favored.

>> ○ **Exception 2.** When the enol form satisfies aromaticity and the keto form does not, the enol form predominates.

> ② Basic Mechanism: Follows Markovnikov's rule, OH<sup>-</sup> adds to the more substituted carbon.

<br>

> ③ Acid Catalyzed Hydration Reaction: Markovnikov Hydration, Carbocation

>> ○ **(Formula)** For alkynes, the acid-catalyzed hydration requires HgSO<sub>4</sub> (catalyst) in addition to the conditions of the acid-catalyzed hydration of alkenes.

>>> ○ Especially for terminal alkynes, since their reactivity is lower, they rely considerably on HgSO<sub>4</sub> catalyst.

>> ○ Carbocation should have a 120° bond angle due to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization, so the reaction where alkene becomes a carbocation is highly unstable.

>>> ○ When both a reactive alkyne and alkene are present, the priority for acid-catalyzed hydration lies with the alkene.

>> ○ **(Formula)** After proceeding with R-C<sup>+</sup>=C<sup>-</sup>-R + (·) → R-C(·)=C<sup>-</sup>-R and adding H<sup>+</sup> to C<sup>-</sup>, <i>anti</i> addition of H<sup>+</sup> occurs to the remaining carbon (∵ steric hindrance).

>> ○ When Na(Li) is melted or solvated, it releases radical electrons through a highly powerful ionization reaction.

>> ○ Solvent: NH<sub>3</sub>. Unusually NH<sub>3</sub> acts as an acid by donating a proton due to steric repulsion.

>> ○ Amines like NH<sub>3</sub> have a pK<sub>a</sub> of around 40, while alkenes have a pK<sub>a</sub> of 45, so reaction can occur spontaneously.

>> ○ Using alcohol as a solvent reacts with Na, so it's inappropriate.

>> ○ Reaction rate slows down with more substituted alkynes (**∵** steric hindrance).

>> ○ [Birch reduction](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1370#:~:text=%E2%91%B7-,Birch%20reduction,-%E2%91%A0%20반응시약%20:%201) and reaction conditions are similar.

**Figure 52.** Ozonolysis reaction of alkynes

<br>

>> ○ Memorize that CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted.

>> ○ The mechanism of ozonolysis reaction of alkynes is not precisely elucidated.

>> ○ Ozonolysis reaction of alkynes occurs starting from multi-substituted alkynes.

> ② When treated with KMnO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>7</sub> and heated

>> ○ Same products as the ozonolysis reaction are obtained.

> ③ Hydroxylation reaction of alkynes

>> ○ Treating alkynes with dilute KMnO4 under cold conditions results in a dihydroxylation reaction occurring twice.

>> ○ Subsequent dehydration leads to the formation of a 1,2-dicarbonyl structure.

⑼ **6.** Other internal reactions

> ① Interconversion between alkynes and terminal alkynes

>> ○ 2-butyne + NH<sub>3</sub> \+ NaNH<sub>2</sub> → 1-butyne

>> ○ 1-butyne + KOH or NaOH → 2-butyne

## **7\. Synthesis of Alkynes**

⑴ [Elimination reactions of _vicinal_ dihalo alkanes or _gem_ dihalo alkanes](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1361)

> ① Internal alkynes require 2 equivalents of strong base per mole (e.g., NaNH<sub>2</sub>, KO(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>).

> ② Terminal alkynes require 3 equivalents of strong base per mole (e.g., NaNH<sub>2</sub>, KO(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>).

> ③ Reason for the need of relatively strong base: It's necessary to go through a process of hydrogen removal from alkenes.

⑵ Produce gem dihalo alkanes through methyl ketone + PCl<sub>5</sub>, then follow ⑴.
