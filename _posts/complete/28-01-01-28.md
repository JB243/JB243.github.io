## **2\. Solution**

 ⑴ **Case 1.** t ＜ 0

**Figure 2.** Case when t < 0

> ① In a circuit composed of stable power sources, when enough time has passed, the coil can be treated as a wire.

> ② The current inside the coil is always continuous and related to energy.

 ⑵ **Case 2.** 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 ms

**Figure 3.** Case when 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 ms

 ⑶ **Case 3.** t > 1 ms

**Figure 4.** Case when t > 1 ms
