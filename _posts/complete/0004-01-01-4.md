> ② Conductance (Unit **:** ℧ or S (siemens)) **:** Degree to which it allows current to flow

## **2. Ohm's Law**

 ⑴ Established experimentally by German scientist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827

 ⑵ **Law:** Approximately valid in Ohmic materials

 ⑶ **Proof**

> ① m **:** Mass of electrons

> ② q **:** Charge of electrons (C) (considering the sign)

> ③ μ **:** Collision frequency (Hz)

> ④ J **:** Current density

> ⑤ σ **:** Electrical conductivity (㎡)

> ⑥ E **:** Electric field (N/C)

> ⑦ N **:** Electron density

> ⑧ For copper commonly used in wires, the time constant τ = 1 / μ = 10^-14, so the term e^-μt can be neglected, leading to the following approximation

>> ○ J(τ) = 0.632 J(∞)

>> ○ J(3τ) = 0.95 J(∞)

>> ○ J(5τ) = 0.99 J(∞)

> ⑨ The following approximately holds in Ohmic materials

>> ○ σ **:** Conductivity

>> ○ ρ **:** Resistivity. The reciprocal of σ
