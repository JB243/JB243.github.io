## **1. Key Notes**

⑴ Binding affinities are commonly quantified by the dissociation constant (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i>) or inhibition constant (<i>K<sub>i</sub></i>).

⑵ General consideration

> ① General properties (e.g., atom types)

> ② Physico-chemical properties (e.g., excluded volume, partial charge, heavy-atom neighbors, hetero-atom neighbors, hybridization)

> ③ Pharmacophoric properties (e.g., hydrophobicity, aromaticity, H-bond donor/acceptor, ring member)

⑶ Datasets

> ① PDBbind database of version 2016

>> ○ **Subset 1.** The general set contains all available data **:** 13,285 protein-ligand complexes

>> ○ **Subset 2.** The refined set, the subset of the general set, contains 4,057 high-quality complexes in total

>> ○ **Subset 3.** [The core 2016 set](https://github.com/JB243/nate9389/blob/main/bin/Test2016_290_smi.csv) **:** 290 complexes from the refined set and for a high-quality benchmark

> ② [CASF-2013](https://github.com/JB243/nate9389/blob/main/bin/Test2013_195_smi.csv) 

> ③ CSAR-HiQ 

>> ○ [CSAR-HiQ_51](https://github.com/JB243/nate9389/blob/main/bin/CSAR-HiQ_51_smi.csv) : Derived from 176 protein-ligand complexes.

>> ○ [CSAR-HiQ_36](https://github.com/JB243/nate9389/blob/main/bin/CSAR-HiQ_36_smi.csv) **:** Derived from 167 protein-ligand complexes.

> ④ Biolip

⑷ Protein-ligand interactions are common, but protein-protein interaction models are still relatively scarce.

## **2. Models**

⑴ Binding position prediction model

> ① Example: AlphaFold multimer

> ② Generally, it is assumed that a ligand-receptor distance of less than 3Å will result in high binding affinity.

⑵ Binding affinity prediction model

> ① **Class 1.** Sequence-based method

>> ○ Example: DeepDTA, DeepDTAF, DeepFusionDTA, GraphDTA, CAPLA 

> ② **Class 2.** Structure-based method

>> ○ Example: Pafnucy, OnionNet, FAST, IGN, IMCP-SF, GLI
