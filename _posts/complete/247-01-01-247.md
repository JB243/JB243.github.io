## **2. Cancer Diseases**

○ BRCA (Breast Cancer)

> ○ Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has a worse prognosis than TNBC and shows greater resistance to chemotherapy.

○ ccRCC (Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma)

> ○ Accounts for 70-80% of RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma).

○ GBM (Glioblastoma)

> ○ Average survival is 12 ~ 18 months.

○ HNSCC (Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma)

> ○ 6th most common cancer globally: 838,860 cases annually.

> ○ ~50% 5-year survival rate.

○ Melanoma

> ○ (+) MAGEA3, HSPA8, NACA, HLA-G.

○ OSCC (Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma)

> ○ Most common head and neck cancer.

> ○ Accounts for over 90% of cancers originating in the oral mucosal epithelium.

○ RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma)

> ○ [Good resource on RCC](https://www.onclive.com/view/adcs-and-radiotherapeutics-represent-novel-treatment-methods-in-rcc)

## **3. Organ-Specific Functional Diseases**

○ AD (Alzheimer's Disease)

> ○ (-) NEUROD6.

○ ALF (Acute Liver Failure): Mortality exceeds 50%.

○ CAD (Coronary Artery Disease)

> ○ The most prevalent heart disease: Accounts for one-third of deaths under the age of 35.

> ○ Treated with antithrombotics.

○ Hercules Syndrome

> ○ Excessive skeletal muscle development due to myostatin deficiency. Visceral muscles are normal. Can strain ligaments, tendons, kidneys, etc.

> ○ Myostatin: Inhibits skeletal muscle development and growth. Involved in ligament and tendon formation and development.

○ Myocardial Infarction: Predicted by elevated ST segment on ECG.

○ MAFLD (Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease)

> ○ Formerly known as NAFLD (Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease).

> ○ Affects about 25% of the adult population worldwide, 40% in the US.

> ○ Emerged as a new disease in the 1980s.

○ NASH: 20 ~ 30% of NAFLD progresses to NASH.

○ [Parkinson's disease](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1207)

> ○ Over 1 million people in the United States are living with PD as of 2020, resulting in an economic burden of $52 billion per year

> ○ Typical onset > 50 years

○ Psoriasis 

> ○ Chronic, inflammatory skin disease 

> ○ Epidemiology: 0.2 to 2.5%. >100 million people with psoriasis worldwide. >4M Americans.

> ○ Economic burden: > $11 billion

> ○ Heritability: ~66% 

○ Pulmonary Fibrosis: 3-year survival rate is only 50%.

○ Rett's Syndrome: Related to methylated cytosine.

## **4. Immune System Diseases**

○ HBV and HCV: Symptoms of HBV and HCV are similar.

> ○ Jaundice

> ○ Joint and muscle aches

> ○ Loss of appetite

> ○ Vomiting

> ○ Dark urine

○ HIV

> ○ Night sweats

> ○ Profound fatigue

> ○ Dry cough

> ○ Rapid weight loss

> ○ Rash
