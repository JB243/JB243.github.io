⑵ Classical hypothesis about the relationship between genes and chromosomes

> ① Sutton's Chromosome Theory: Genes are small particles in the chromosome.

> ② Morgan's Chromosome: Allele is at the same locus on the gene.

⑶ Classical experiment that identified DNA as a genetic material  

> ① Transformation experiment

>> ○ Griffith experiment: R-type bacteria are transformed into S-type.

>> ○ Avery experiment: Advances Griffith's experiment and reveals that DNA is the material that causes transformation.

> ② Hershey and Chase Experiment

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Bacteriophage are labeled with radioactive isotopes: <sup>32</sup>P for DNA labeling, <sup>35</sup>S for protein labeling.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Infect the E. coli and culture it.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Use a blender to separate the E. coli from the phages.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Use centrifugation to separate the nuclei and the rest.

>> ○ Composition of DNA: C, H, O, N, P

>> ○ Composition of proteins: C, H, O, N, S

>> ○ Demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material using E. coli and T2 phages.

>> ○ E. coli and T2 phages have significant size differences, making separation possible.

> ③ Additional evidence that DNA is genetic material  

>> ○ Chargaff's rules: [A] = [T], [G] = [C] (proven by paper-chromatography)

>> ○ The amount of DNA in all somatic cells of an individual is the same.

>> ○ DNA amount fluctuates during cell division.

>> ○ Highest mutation rate for light at 260 nm (DNA maximum absorption wavelength). No mutation at 280 nm.

⑷ Amount of DNA

> ① One chromosome consists of one DNA.

> ② One chromosome consists of 10<sup>7</sup> - 10<sup>10</sup> bp.

> ③ Total amount of DNA consists of 3 × 10<sup>9</sup> bp.

⑸ Gene: DNA sequence that encodes a protein and is transcribed into mRNA.

> ① Full length of the human genome = 3 billion base pairs

> ② About 30,000 genes in the human genome. Total length of genes = 50 million base pair

> ③ 10<sup>3</sup> -10<sup>6</sup> bp for each gene

> ④ Allele: Different genes with different sequences at the same locus on DNA.

> ⑤ Siblings on average share about 50% of allele.

> ⑥ Reason: This is because the probability of a given gene matching either the paternal or maternal side is 50%.

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Mendel Genetics**

⑴ Genotypes and Phenotypes

> ① Character: Features that differ between individuals (_e.g._, Color).

> ② Allelic character: Characters that can be clearly contrasted with each other among traits (e.g., The shape is more clearly defined as round in contrast to wrinkled.)

> ③ Trait (phenotype): Type of character represented by an individual (e.g., Purple, Red)

>> ○ Wild type (wt), mutant (mt), dominant trait, recessive trait  

> ④ Genotype: Type of gene an individual has.

>> ○ Homozygote: The case that both allele are the same (e.g., AA, BB, OO)

>> ○ Heterozygote: The case that two alleles are different (e.g., AB, AO)

> ⑤ Recessive trait: Phenotypes of allele only in homozygotes (e.g., OO)

> ⑥ Dominant trait: Phenotypes that also appear in heterozygotes (e.g., AA, AO; BO, BB)

> ⑦ Carrier: Heterozygote for recessive disease

> ⑧ Mating

>> ○ Unisexual mating (e.g., Aa), bisexual mating (e.g., AaBb)

>> ○ Self-pollination (↔ Cross pollination): Breeding between individuals with the same genotype, often used for improving a breed.

>> ○ Testcross: By mating an individual with a homozygous recessive individual, the genotype can be determined.

>> ○ Reciprocal cross: Breeding a maternal line with the father's genotype and a paternal line with the mother's genotype. This can determine whether there is sex-linked inheritance.

>> ○ p generation, F<sub>1</sub> generation (hybrid first generation), F<sub>2</sub> generation (hybrid second generation)

⑵ Mendel's law

> ① Mendelian traits: Traits for which the pattern of inheritance can be easily determined, as in Mendel's experiments.

> ② Plant hybrid research (1860s): Study on the inheritance of seven allelic traits in peas, with clear dominance and recessiveness.

>> ○ Shell of peas: Round gray, Wrinkled white

>>> ○ An allele encodes an enzyme called SBE (starch branching enzyme), which is related to amylopectin.

>>> ○ Wrinkled peas have higher osmotic pressure: they become wrinkled when they absorb water and swell, then dry.

>> ○ Color of peas: Yellow, Green

>> ○ Color of flowers: White, Purple (Red)

>> ○ Shape of pods: Smooth pods, Creased pods

>> ○ Color of pods: Yellow, Green

>> ○ The place where flowers bloom: Between the branches, or at the top.

>> ○ Stem size: Big, Small

> ③ Advantages of peas

>> ○ Peas have a short generation (3 months).

>> ○ Pea leaves a lot of offspring.

>> ○ Pea is easy to grow and easy to control reproduction.

>> ○ Peas are capable of both self-fertilization and cross-fertilization.

>> ○ Pea traits and dominance/recessiveness are very clear.

>> ○ Although the alleles are linked and positioned far apart, they seem to adhere to the law of independence.

> ④ Highlights the design of experiments and the importance of mathematical thinking (statistics) of results.

>> ○ Mendel conducts testcross to determine if an individual is true-breeding.

> ⑤ Mendel's law

>> ○ Several types of allele are used to determine traits.

>> ○ **The Law of Dominance:** When pure lines with opposing traits are crossed, only one of the parent's traits appears in the F<sub>1</sub> generation.

>>> ○ This means that in a heterozygous individual, only one allele's trait is expressed.

>>> ○ The trait that appears in heterozygotes is dominant, while the other is recessive.

>>> ○ This contrasts with the blending inheritance hypothesis.

>> ○ **The Law of Segregation:** Since reproductive cells contain half the genetic material, only one of the two alleles is passed on.

>>> ○ An individual inherits only two alleles, one from each parent.

>>> ○ The forked line method can be applied.

>> ○ **The Law of Independence:** Genes that are not in an allelic relationship are assumed to assort independently during gamete formation. Doesn't consider linkage along the same chromosome.

>>> ○ A 9:3:3:1 ratio in the case of A_B_ : aaB_ : A_bb : aabb suggests independence.

⑶ Genotyping via Punnett square

> ① Example: Round yellow and wrinkled green

<br>

⑸ Complementary Test (Cis-Trans Test)

> ① Definition: It is a test to determine whether certain genes related to a specific mutant trait are the same gene or different genes.

> ② Example: In the example below, there are a total of three mutant genes: Gene 1 (= Gene 3 = Gene 5), Gene 2, and Gene 4.

⑹ Hereditary diseases

> ① Achondroplasia

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Linkage and Cross**

⑴ Drosophila research

> ① Theoretical formulation of the linkage is made by studying fruit flies, starting with Morgan.

> ② Benefits of Drosophila as a Genetic Study

>> ○ Readily available.

>> ○ Breeding is easy and does not harm person.

>> ○ Breeds a lot and breeds every 2 weeks.

>> ○ Small number of chromosomes: 4 pairs of chromosomes.  

⑵ Linkage

> ① Two or more non-alleles exist on the same chromosome and behave identically.

> ② Man has 23 linkage groups.

> ③ Cis-configuration and Trans-configuration  

>> ○ Cis-configuration (coupling): Individuals with AB and ab chromosomes

>> ○ Trans-configuration (repulsion): Individuals with Ab and aB Chromosomes

>> ○ When doing cross experiments, you should first determine whether you are based on cis-configuration or trans-configuration.

>> ○ **Case 1.** Cis-configuration AaBb × Cis-configuration AaBb

>>> ○ The probability that the offspring have the same genotype as the parents is 1/2: <span>(AB | ab) → (AB | ab)</span>

>>> ○ There are 2 types of phenotypes in the offspring: A_B_, aabb

>> ○ **Case 2.** Trans-configuration AaBb × Trans-configuration AaBb

>>> ○ The probability that the offspring have the same genotype as the parents is 1/2: <span>(Ab | aB) → (Ab | aB)</span>

>> ○ There are 3 types of phenotypes in the offspring: A_B_, A_bb, aaB_ 

>> ○ **Case 3.** Cis-configuration AaBb × Trans-configuration AaBb

>>> ○ There are 3 types of phenotypes in the offspring: A_B_, A_bb, aaB_

>> ○ In **Cases 1** to **3**, A is dominant over a, and B is dominant over b.

>> ○ [Example problem](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1394)

> ④ Complete linkage and incomplete linkage

>> ○ Complete linkage: Linkage that produces only parent type. If two genes are very close and have fewer offspring.

>>> ○ In other words, when there is 100% genetic linkage.

>>> ○ A_B_ : aaB_ : A_bb : aabb = 3 : 0 : 0 : 1 means cis-configuration complete linkage.

>>> ○ A_B_ : aaB_ : A_bb : aabb = 2 : 1 : 1 : 0 means trans-configuration complete linkage.

>> ○ Incomplete linkage: Produces both parental and recombinant (crossover) traits.

⑶ Crossover

> ① Exchange between sister chromatid segments occurs when bivalent chromosomes (tetrad) are formed during the prophase of the first meiotic division.

>> ○ First-Division Segregation (FDS): When there is no crossing over

>> ○ Second-Division Segregation (SDS): When there is crossing over
   
>> ○ Chiasma: The location where crossing over occurs. The number of chiasmata is proportional to chromosome length.

> ② The recombination rate is proportional to the distance between two linked genes.

> ③ **Formula 1:** Crossover rate = (Number of gametes where crossing over occurs ÷ Total number of gametes) × 100

> ④ **Formula 2:** Crossover rate = (Number of offspring resulting from crossing over in a test cross ÷ Total number of offspring obtained in a test cross) × 100

> ⑤ Multiple crossovers: The probability of multiple crossovers is theoretically equal to the product of the probabilities of each individual single crossover.

>> ○ 1-2 crossover events typically occur for each chromosomal pair in each gamete.

> ⑥ The crossover rate is a maximum of 50%: When the distance between two genes is very large, they satisfy the law of independence, and in the case of independence, the crossover rate is 50%.

> ⑦ Issues with calculating crossover rate

>> ○ If an even number of crossovers occur between two linked genes, they do not contribute to the crossover rate.

>> ○ Interference: One crossover event can inhibit (negative interference, most commonly) or promote (positive interference) another crossover event.

>> ○ As the distance between two genes increases, the crossover rate becomes less accurate.

>> ○ In most cases, an equal and equivalent amount of DNA is exchanged. However, unequal crossover can result in copy number variants (CNVs) as well as inversions and translocations.

>> ○ Crossover is non-random; over 25,000 small regions of elevated recombination have been characterized as recombination hotspots.

⑷ Gene map

> ① A plot of the location of genes on a chromosome based on crossover rates obtained by three-point test crosses.

>> ○ Test cross: A cross between an individual that is heterozygous for all genes and a homozygous recessive individual.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Group the 8 organisms into pairs.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The majority of pairs will display the parental type.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. At least one pair of individuals contains the gene located in the middle on the map: Using the double crossover rate

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Calculate the crossover rate between the intermediate gene and each of the other genes to estimate map distance of genes.

> ② 1 cM (centi-Morgan): A map distance where the crossover rate is 1%.

> ③ Double crossovers

>> ○ For values below 25 cM, there is an almost proportional relationship between recombination frequency and map distance.  

>> ○ For values above 25 cM, the crossover rate appears lower compared to the map distance.  

>> ○ Reason: This is due to the occurrence of double crossovers. In each gamete, typically 1–2 crossovers occur per chromosome.  

>> ○ Application: The crossover rate between the two most distant genes is smaller than the sum of the distances between the respective intermediate genes.  

<br>

<br>

## **4\. Non-mendel Genetics**

⑴ Co-dominance: Both alleles are expressed as phenotypes.

> ① MN blood type

> ② ABO blood type: I<sup>A</sup> and I<sup>B</sup> are co-dominant. i is recessive.

<br>

<img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cFna3c/btrzX0e37xg/yGs9ZWmhVdajgwytxdQ5lk/img.png" alt="drawing" />

<b>Figure 5.</b> ABO blood type inheritance 

<br>

>> ○ The gene encoding the glycoprotein on the surface of red blood cells located on chromosome 19.

>> ○ AB type: I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup>

>> ○ A type: I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup> or I<sup>A</sup>i

>> ○ B type: I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup> or I<sup>B</sup>i

>> ○ O type: ii

⑵ Incomplete dominance (intermediate inheritance)

> ① A complete phenotype is expressed only in homozygotes, while the phenotype of heterozygotes is intermediate.

> ② Quantitative inheritance: Usually pigments, receptors (e.g., Inheritance of hypercholesterolemia and LDL receptors)

> ③ Flower color of snapdragon: Rr × Rr

>> ○ RR : Rr : rr = Red : Pink : White = 1 : 2 : 1

>> ○ **Tip:** The inheritance of color is not a common dominant but an incomplete dominant.

⑶ Multiple alleles inheritance: A case where more than three alleles exist at a single gene locus, often originating from mutations.

> ① The ABO blood type gene is determined by three alleles (multiple alleles).

⑷ Pleiotropy: The effect of a single allele influencing two or more phenotypes.

> ① Cystic fibrosis (CF): Recessive genetic disease

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. A defect in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Mutations occur in channels that transport chlorine ions out of epithelial cells.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Excessive chloride ions are secreted, causing a significant amount of water to be released outside the epithelial cells.

>> ○ Symptom: Accumulation of thick mucus, repeated lung infections, digestive problems, impaired liver function, shortened lifespan

>> ○ Among white Americans, it occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500 individuals.  

>> ○ Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections are a major cause of death in CF patients.

> ② Hemophilia(factor Ⅶ): Excessive bleeding, bruising, joint pain and swelling, loss of vision, etc.

> ③ Sickle cell anemia

>> ○ Definition: A disease caused by the substitution of the 6th amino acid in the β-chain of hemoglobin from glutamic acid (Glu, hydrophilic) to valine (Val, hydrophobic).

>>> ○ N terminal - Val - His - Leu - Thr - Pro - **Glu/Val** - Glu - ···

>> ○ Types of hemoglobin variants: Approximately 500 Types

>>> ○ Most are caused by the substitution of a single amino acid in the globin polypeptide chain.

>>> ○ **Example 1.** HbS (sickle-cell Hb): Substitution of a single Glu with Val on the surface.

>>> ○ **Example 2.** Hb Cowtown: Removal of an ion pair involved in T-state stabilization.

>>> ○ **Example 3.** Hb Memphis: Substitution of a similar-sized residue on the surface with a polar but uncharged residue. Nearly a neutral mutation.

>>> ○ **Example 4.** Hb Bibba: Substitution of one Leu with Pro, affecting the α-helix.

>>> ○ **Example 5.** Hb Milwaukee: Substitution of one Val with Glu.

>>> ○ **Example 6.** Hb Providence: One Lysine (Lys) that normally sticks out at the center of the tetramer is replaced with Asparagine (Asn). This decreases BPG binding and increases oxygen saturation.

>>> ○ **Example 7.** Hb Philly: One Tyrosine (Tyr) is replaced with Phenylalanine (Phe), breaking a hydrogen bond at the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>1</sub> junction site. This increases BPG binding and decreases oxygen saturation.

>> ○ Mechanism: When a hydrophilic amino acid is replaced with a hydrophobic amino acid, huge structural changes occur.

>>> ○ Clumping (fibrosis) of mutant hemoglobin: Due to hydrophobic interactions, hemoglobin molecules stick together and form fibers.

>>> ○ The formation of fibers is the reason why hemoglobin takes on a sickle shape.

>>> ○ The same genetic mutation is not observed in myoglobin: This is because myoglobin functions as a single monomer.

>> ○ Trait based on genetic type

>>> ○ Dominant homozygous: Normal red blood cells.

>>> ○ Recessive homozygotes: Sickle-shaped red blood cells, significantly increased resistance to malaria (↑↑), but severely reduced oxygen transport efficiency (↓↓).  

>>> ○ Heterozygotes: Some red blood cells are sickle-shaped, increased resistance to malaria (↑), and slightly reduced oxygen transport efficiency (↓).  

>> ○ Symptoms: Rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, dementia, weakened immunity, stroke, and heart weakness.

>> ○ Treatment: Currently, there is no cure for sickle cell anemia, but bone marrow transplantation can help improve symptoms.

> ④ Tay-Sachs disease: Autosomal recessive disease

>> ○ Lipid metabolism disease caused by hexoseaminidase A deficiency.

>> ○ It manifests in newborns and typically leads to death around the age of 3.

> ⑤ Phenylketonuria (PKU): Autosomal recessive diseases

>> ○ Definition: A disorder where PAH (Phenylalanine Hydroxylase) cannot be synthesized.

>>> ○ PAH (Phenylalanine Hydroxylase): An enzyme that hydroxylates phenylalanine into tyrosine.

>>> ○ Tyrosine: Essential for the production of thyroxine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and melanin.

>> ○ Phenylalanine accumulates in the blood and is eventually excreted in the urine, producing dark-colored urine.

>>> ○ Converts to phenylpyruvic acid, causing acidosis, neural tube developmental disorders, intellectual disability, and pale skin.

>>> ○ Around 3 to 5 months of age, infants show indifference and do not respond to their environment.

>>> ○ By the age of 1, significant intellectual decline becomes noticeable: Even in adulthood, the IQ often remains below 50.

>> ○ Diagnosis: Phenylpyruvic acid, a kind of phenylketone, in the urine are detected using ferric chloride, turning green (normal individuals show a brown color).

>> ○ Treatment: If a newborn consumes a low-phenylalanine diet from early infancy, normal nervous system development can be achieved.

⑸ Multifactorial Freedom: Quantitative inheritance involving more than one gene (seat) in one phenotype

> ① Distinguished from abdominal alleles in terms of one phenotype

> ② Skin color, eye color: Multiple melanin transpeptidase + carrier protein → melanin content

>> ○ Melanin is a dark brown pigment made from tyrosine

>> ○ Albinism in the absence of tyrosinase

> ③ At least three genes determine height

>> ○ F1 with AABBCC × aabbcc: Normal distribution is observed when AaBbCc crosses

>> ○ Normal distribution: <sub>6</sub>C<sub>0</sub>: <sub>6</sub>C<sub>1</sub>: <sub>6</sub>C<sub>2</sub>: <sub>6</sub>C<sub>3</sub>: <sub>6</sub>C<sub>4</sub>: <sub>6</sub>C<sub>5</sub>: <sub>6</sub>C<sub>6</sub>

> ④ cis AB type

>> ○ Mutations in which A and B genes exist at different loci on one chromosome

>> ○ O children can be born from AB parents

⑹ Difference: When one gene affects the phenotype of another gene

> ① Fur color 9: 3: 4

>> ○ Pigment gene and pigment precipitation gene are involved

>> ○ 9: 3: 3: Pigment precipitation genes from 1 reflect recessive homozygotes 3 and 1 as 4

>> ○ Tip. 12 in any experiment: 3: 1, 9: 6: 1, 9: 3: 4, 9: If 7 is observed, the top!

> ② Bogye Gene: Non-alleles that complement one another to express one trait

> ③ Bombay O phenotype

>> ○ H gene: A gene that attaches a fucose sugar to the surface of red blood cells to determine blood types

>> ○ Type O children may be born in combinations where type O children cannot be born if the H gene is recessive homozygous. That is, the H locus is higher than the I locus

>> ○ H gene is on chromosome 19

>> ○ ABO allele is present on chromosome 9

> ④ Double recessive gene 15: 1

⑺ Zealous death: Symptoms often develop at a young age

> ① AB × AB = AA, AB, BA, BB BB dies and only AA, AB, BA appear

>> ○ A trait if A is dominant than B: B trait = 1: Appears as a percentage of 0

>> ○ If A is recessive than B, A trait: B trait = 1: Appears as a ratio of 2

> ② Example: Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, albinoosis, Tay-Sachs disease, etc.

⑻ Dominant: Symptoms often develop late

> ① Genotypes and Traits. ⑺-①)

> ② Example: Huntingtons' disease

>> ○ It occurs at 30-40 years old, so it can be transmitted later

>> ○ Progressive refractory to lethal neuronal cell death, brain dysfunction, central nervous system disorder, chorea symptoms

>> ○ Died 10-20 years after onset of a physiological disorder

>> ○ HD gene on chromosome 4: 3114 aa protein code → accumulates in brain nuclei, forms toxic protein masses, and kills brain cells

>> ○ 5'-CAG repeat sequence: Promote the Departure of RNA Polymerase

>> ○ 5'-CAG 9-36 reps: Normal

>> ○ 5'-CAG repeats 37-66 times: poly Q is a glutamine code, affecting 40 at 40 repetitions

>> ○ 5'-CAG 33-36 reps: Preliminary Mutations, Likely to Increase in Offspring

>> ○ 5'-CAG over 100 repetitions: Onset at 2 years old

> ③ Incomplete dominance: If the dyzygotes do not lead to fatality but have fatal symptoms such as malformations

>> ○ Example: Cartilage development achondroplasia (achondroplasia)

⑼ Genome stamping and non-nuclear inheritance

> ① Dielectric Imprinting

>> ○ Phenotypes change depending on which trait is passed from parents

>> ○ Caused by DNA methylation (C base) (mostly due to methylation of CpG islands)  

>> ○ During germ cell generation, all genes are demethylated to release imprinting and remethylated depending on whether they are sperm or ovum

>> ○ Male individuals receiving maternal imprints and heterozygous and recessive traits may show dominant traits due to paternal imprints

>> ○ Example: IgF-1 Gene in Mice

>> ○ **Example 1.** IgF-1 Gene in Mice: Incidental imprinting insulator methylation → transcription promotion, maternal imprinting promoter methylation → transcription inhibition

>> ○ **Example 2.** Prader-Willi Syndrome and Angelman Syndrome

>>> ○ Recessive traits due to chromosomal deletion and genomic engraving

>>> ○ Prader Willi syndrome: Deleting chromosome 15. Non-deleting sites of the maternal chromosome are imprinted due to methylation, preventing the expression of the PWS gene

>>> ○ Angelman syndrome: Maternal Chromosome 15 deletion. The non-deleting site of the paternal chromosome is imprinted due to methylation, resulting in no AS gene

> ② Maternal effect: Cytoplasmic determinants

>> ○ Proteins needed early in development are transferred from mothers to mRNA because they lack time to transcrib

>> ○ Regardless of germ cell genotype, any cytoplasmic determinant is transferred to germ cells if there is any allele in the maternal line

>> ○ Genotype and phenotype should be considered separately

>>> ○ Example: Recessive lethal genotyzygote exists when there is no problem in survival but reproduction is impossible

>> ○ Infer the genotype of the mother from the phenotype of the offspring

>>> ○ If the children are all dominant traits, the mother's genotype is dominant

>>> ○ If the children are all recessive traits, the mother's genotype is recessive

>> ○ Example: Early Drosophila, Snail Shell's Right Helix, Left Helix, Moth Larva Eye Color Genetic

> ③ Cytoplasmic inheritance

>> ○ Chromosome inheritance

>> ○ mitochondria genetic: Maternal inheritance

>>> ○ Electron Transfer System and ATP Transpeptidase Encode mitochondria DNA

>>> ○ heteroplasmy phenomenon: Because mitochondria cooperate with many organelles (mainly the nucleus), children of mothers who are sick are not all sick.

>>> ○ **Problem type 1.** When following the Mendelian Gene when mating with mutants: Nuclear DNA abnormalities required for mitochondria function

>>> ○ **Problem type 2.** When following a maternal inheritance when mating with a mutant: mitochondria DNA abnormalities

>>> ○ **Problem type 3.** Leaven: mitochondria originated from parent

> ④ Sex-controlled inheritance: The genes are on the autosomal chromosome but the expression of the genes by sex (eg: Change of superiority)

>> ○ **Example 1.** Antler gene is dominant in males. Recessive expression in females

>> ○ **Example 2.** Bald genes are dominant in males encoding 5α-reductase, which converts testosterone to dehydrotestosterone (DHT) (enhancing males). Recessive expression in women

>> ○ Women have thinning hair rather than baldness

> ⑤ Xenia: Paternity  

<br>

<br>

## **5\. Sex and sex-related**

⑴ Determination of sex

> ① Sex determination by chromosomes

>> ○ XY type: ♂ (XY), ♀ (XO), yes: Person

>> ○ XO type: ♂ (XO), ♀ (XX)

>> ○ ZW type: ♂ (ZZ), ♀ (ZW), poultry

>> ○ ZO type: ♂ (ZZ), ♀ (ZO)

>> ○ Haploid-drainage type  

> ② Sex determination by environment

>> ○ Example: The reptile's sex is determined by the incubation temperature of the eggs

> ③ Determination of gender by modification

>> ○ Example: Unfertilized bees are male, fertilized bees are female

> ④ Gender conversion

>> ○ Example: Some fish have only some individuals turned into males by social cues.

> ⑤ Hermaphrodite

>> ○ Example: C. elegans has both male and female reproductive organs

⑵ Sex-related inheritance: Genes is sex-related, if cross-crossing results in significant differences

> ① 18 common genes on X and Y chromosomes

> ② Y chromosome-associated gene (Hansung Gene): Very few genes. SRY genes determine sex

>> ○ SRY (Sex Region of Y Chromosome)

>> ○ Drosophila sex determinant is on the X chromosome

> ③ X chromosome-associated genetics: Males express X-associated traits more frequently than females

>> ○ Color blindness: Green and Red Opsin Genes (X Chromosome)

>>> ○ Blue opsin gene (chromosome 7)

>> ○ Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)

>>> ○ X-chromosome recessive inheritance, incidence of 1 / 3,500 males

>>> ○ The most severe of the 10 muscular dystrophy, muscle cell degeneration

>>> ○ Adolescent dies of adulthood due to wheelchair use, breathing and heart disease

>>> ○ DMD gene: 2.4 million bp, consisting of more than 70 exons, encoding dystrophin protein

>>> ○ Dystrophin: Linkage protein between cytoskeleton and six proteins that regulate calcium ionophore in muscle cell membranes

>>> ○ DMD gene is channel deregulated due to deletion of exon

>> ○ Hemophilia  

> ④ Sex-controlled inheritance (See. 4-⑼): Actually not sex-related 

> ⑤ X inactivation: Observed only in mammals

>> ○ Defition: Females have two X chromosomes, so inactivating one of them for quantitative compensation

>>> ○ Drosophila and pretty little nematodes double the expression of male X chromosomes for quantitative compensation

>> ○ Barr body: Inactivated X chromosome, cause of mosaic pattern (eg: Cat pattern)

>>> ○ Only in mammals

>> ○ Leon Hypothesis: Female early embryos randomly inactivate one X chromosome in each cell

>>> ○ Depending on the animal, the basoche occurs before or in the eggplant

>>> ○ Inactivation is irreversible but only inactivated during germ cell formation

>>> ○ If you have a basso once: All progeny cells produced by somatic cell division are condensed at the same site (eg: Cancer cells)

>> ○ Mechanism

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Generation of Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) from Xist RNA on X chromosome with inactivation determined

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. X chromosome, determined to be activated, methylates Xist RNA to prevent inactivation mechanisms

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. RNA transcribed from the Xist binds to the corresponding X chromosome

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Blocking transcription of X chromosome, which caused RNA interference and determined inactivation

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Xist additionally attaches methyl groups to cytosine (C) and deacetylates histones to condense the chromosome → inhibit transcription

<br>

<br>

## **6\. Quantitative Genetics-Genetics and the Environment**

⑴ Quantitative traits: Height, weight, etc.): Due to both genetic and environmental differences

> ① Genetic factors: Multifactor inheritance

>> ○ Traits that have high inheritance indices are consistently expressed regardless of the environment

> ② Environmental factors: Environmental dependence of genes, environmental dependence of traits

>> ○ Example: Study of identical twins grown in different environments

⑵ penetrance (penetrance): The extent to which the expected traits of a particular genotype actually appear

> ① Complete penetrance: 100% trait is expressed as predicted by genotype

> ② Incomplete penetrance

> ③ Example: Dominant disease, which is a dominant disease, has 80% penetrance

⑶ expressivity (expressivity): The severity of the phenotype expressed in an individual

⑷ Heritability (inheritance index): Degree of contribution to variation within the genetic population

> ① Calculation through correlation analysis between groups

>> ○ Example: Parents and offspring have the same degree of immunity

> ② 0.2 to 0.4: Genetic

> ③ 0.4 to: Very genetic

> ④ Heredity is based on populations, not individual differences

> ⑤ Genetic traits can also vary by environment

## **7\. Genetic testing**

⑴ Family Tree Analysis

> ① **Tip 1.** Superiority

>> ○ When a sick parent has children who are not sick: Dominant oil field

>> ○ If you have a sick child among parents who are not sick: Recessive oil field

> ② **Tip 2.** Determining if it is sex-related

>> ○ **Tip 2-1.** When a sick father's daughter is always sick: Dominant X-linked oil field

>> ○ **Tip 2-2.** When the sick mother's son is always sick: Recessive X-linked oil field

>> ○ Y chromosome is less related to disease because of less gene

>> ○ ① Determines the superiority of the chromosome and knows that it is not X-linked through tips 2-1 and 2-2.

> ③ Family tree problems are difficult to come out except above

⑵ Fetal examination  

> ① Amniocentesis: Around 14-16 weeks of pregnancy. Biochemistry and karyotyping after fetal cell collection from amniotic fluid

> ② Chorion projections: Around 6-8 weeks of pregnancy. Biochemistry and karyotyping after chorionic villus collection

⑶ Genetic analysis
