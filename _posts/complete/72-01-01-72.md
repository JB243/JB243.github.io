⑵ Classical hypothesis about the relationship between genes and chromosomes

> ① Sutton's Chromosome Theory **:** Genes are small particles in the chromosome.

> ② Morgan's Chromosome **:** allele is at the same locus on the gene.

⑵ Classical experiment that identified DNA as a genetic material  

> ① Transformation experiment

>> ○ Griffith experiment **:** R-type bacteria are transformed into S-type

>> ○ Avery experiment **:** Advances Griffith's experiment and reveals that DNA is the material that causes transformation

> ② Hershey and Chase Experiment

>> ○ Isotopes of 32P (DNA labeled) and 35S (protein labeled) using phages labeled with radioisotopes, respectively

>> ○ A member of DNA **:** Members of C, H, O, N, P ↔ Proteins **:** C, H, O, N, S

>> ○ E. coli and T2 phage prove DNA to be genetic material

>> ○ E. coli and T2 phage can be separated due to significant differences in size

> ③ Additional evidence that DNA is genetic material  

>> ○ Shagaf's Law **:** [A] = [T], [G] = [C] (proven by paper-chromatography)

>> ○ The amount of DNA in all somatic cells of an individual is the same

>> ○ DNA amount fluctuates during cell division

>> ○ Highest mutation rate for light at 260 nm (DNA maximum absorption wavelength). No mutation at 280 nm

⑶ Amount of DNA

> ① One chromosome consists of one DNA

> ② One chromosome consists of 10<sup>7</sup> - 10<sup>10</sup> bp

> ③ Total amount of DNA consists of 3 × 10<sup>9</sup> bp

⑷ Gene **:** DNA sequence that encodes a protein and is transcribed into mRNA

> ① About 30,000 genes in the human genome

> ② 10<sup>3</sup> -10<sup>6</sup> bp

> ③ Allele **:** Different genes with different sequences at the same locus on DNA

> ④ Siblings on average share about 50% of allele

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Mendel Genetics**

⑴ Genotypes and Phenotypes

> ① Character **:** Features that differ between individuals (_e.g._, Color)  

> ② Allele **:** Traits that can be clearly contrasted with each other among traits (e.g., The shape is rounded ↔ clear compared to wrinkled)

> ③ Trait, phenotype **:** The type of trait represented by an individual (e.g., Purple, red)

>> ○ Wild type (wt), mutant (mt), dominant trait, recessive trait  

> ④ Genotype **:** Type of gene a person has

>> ○ Zygote (homozygous) **:** If both allele are the same (AA, BB, OO)

>> ○ Zygote (heterozygous) **:** Two alleles are different (AB, AO)

> ⑤ Zeal **:** phenotype of allele (OO) only in isozygotes

> ⑥ Dominant **:** Phenotypes that also appear in heterozygotes (AA, AO; BO, BB)

> ⑦ Carrier **:** Dyzyzyte for febrile disease

> ⑧ Mating

>> ○ Unisexual mating (ex. Aa), bisexual (ex. AaBb)

>> ○ Self Moisture (↔ Taga Moisture) **:** Used when breeding or breeding varieties of the same genotype

>> ○ Testcross **:** Genotypes can be determined by mating with one individual and one with thermozygous

>> ○ Cross-crossing (reciprocal cross) **:** Crossbreeding between mothers with paternal genotypes and with maternal genotypes. Can know if it is sex-related

>> ○ p generation, F1 generation (hybrid first generation), F2 generation (hybrid second generation)

⑵ Mendel's law

> ① Mendel Traits **:** Traits whose genetic methods can be easily identified, such as Mendel's experiment

> ② Plant hybrid research (1860s) **:** 7 Allele Genetic Study of Pea with Clear and Recessive Peas

>> ○ Shell of beans **:** Round gray, wrinkled white

>>> ○ allele is an enzyme encoding starch branch enzyme (SBE) associated with amylopectin

>>> ○ Wrinkled peas have greater osmotic pressure **:** Wrinkles when dried in swollen state with water

>> ○ Color of beans **:** Yellow, green

>> ○ Color of flowers **:** White, purple (red)

>> ○ Shape of pods **:** Smooth Pods, Creased Pods

>> ○ Color of pods **:** Yellow, green

>> ○ Flower blooming **:** Between branches

>> ○ Stem size **:** Big, small

> ③ Peas Advantage

>> ○ Peas have a short generation (3 months)

>> ○ Pea leaves a lot of offspring

>> ○ Pea is easy to grow and easy to control reproduction

>> ○ Peas are capable of both self-fertilization and cross-fertilization.

>> ○ Pea traits and superiority are very clear

>> ○ A pair of alleles are far apart and follow associations but look like the law of independence

> ④ Design of experiments, highlighting the importance of mathematical thinking (statistics) of results

>> ○ Mendel conducts testcross to determine if an individual is true-breeding

> ⑤ Mendel's law **:** Law of Separation (uniform), Superiority (uniform), Independence law (positive)

>> ○ Several types of allele are used to determine traits

>> ○ Rule of superiority **:** The law states that only one parental trait appears at F1 when crossing two alleles that are alleles.

>>> ○ In other words, heterozygous means that only one allele is expressed.  

>>> ○ The traits present in the heterozygote are dominant, otherwise the traits are recessive

>>> ○ Contrast with mixed theory  

>> ○ The law of separation **:** Because germ cells are half genes, only one of the two alleles is delivered

>>> ○ One entity inherits only two alleles from each parent

>>> ○ Forked line can be applied

>> ○ Law of independence **:** Two genes that are not allele are assumed to be unigenic independently. Do not consider association

>>> ○ A\_B\_ **:** aaB\_ **:** A\_bb **:** aabb = 9 **:** 3 **:** 3 **:** Independent if 1

⑶ Genotyping via funnet squares

> Example **:** Round yellow and wrinkle green

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Association and Cross**

⑴ Drosophila Research

> ① Theoretical formulation of the association is made by studying fruit flies, starting with Morgan.

> ② Benefits of Drosophila as a Genetic Study

>> ○ Readily available.

>> ○ Breeding is easy and does not harm person.

>> ○ Breeds a lot and breeds every 2 weeks.

>> ○ 4 pairs of chromosomes.  

⑵ Linkage

> ① Two or more non-alleles exist on the same chromosome and behave identically

> ② Man has 23 related groups

> ③ Merchant and Class  

>> ○ Merchant (coupling, cis-configuration) **:** Individuals with AB and ab chromosomes

>> ○ Repulsion (trans-configuration) **:** Individuals with Ab and aB Chromosomes

>> ○ When doing cross experiments, you should first determine whether you are based on merchants or traders.

> ④ Completely incomplete

>> ○ Complete linkage **:** Association that produces only parent type. If two genes are very close and have fewer offspring

>>> ○ That is, if it is 100%

>>> ○ A\_B\_ **:** aaB\_ **:** A\_bb **:** aabb = 3 **:** 0 **:** 0 **:** 1 means merchant

>>> ○ A\_B\_ **:** aaB\_ **:** A\_bb **:** aabb = 2 **:** 1 **:** 1 **:** If 0, upper half is completely associated  

>> ○ Incomplete linkage **:** Produces both parental and recombinant (crossover)

⑶ Crossover

> ① Sister chromosome fragments exchanged during chromosome tetrad formation

>> ○ First-division segregation (FDS) **:** No intersection

>> ○ Second-division segregation (SDS) **:** If there is an intersection

>> ○ chiasma (chiasma) **:** Where the intersection took place. Number is proportional to chromosome length

> ② Crossover rate is proportional to distance between two associated genes

> ③ **Formula 1** **:** Crossover rate = number of germ cells at which crossover occurs ÷ total number of germ cells produced by F1 × 100

> ④ **Formula 2** **:** Crossover ratio = Number of individuals resulting from intersection ÷ Number of individuals obtained as a result of the test cross × 100

> ⑤ Multiple crosses **:** The probability of multiple crosses is theoretically equal to the product of each independent single cross probability

> ⑥ Crossover rate up to 50% **:** If the distance between two genes is very distant, the law of independence is satisfied and the crossover rate at independence is 50%.

> ⑦ Cross rate calculation problem

>> ○ Even crossings between two associated genes are not reflected in the crossing rate

>> ○ Interference **:** Intersection of one site interferes (negative, mostly) or facilitates (positive)

>> ○ As the distance between two genes increases, the crossover rate becomes inaccurate

⑷ Gene map

> ① A plot of the location of genes on a chromosome based on crossover rates obtained by three-point test crosses

>> ○ Black cross **:** Crossbreeding between individuals with heterozygous genes and recessive isozytes

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Group two of eight objects

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Multiple pairs of parents

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Genes with at least one pair of individuals in between (because double-crossing is very unlikely)

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Calculate the crossover rate between an intermediate gene and each of the other genes

>> ○ See. The crossover rate between the two furthest genes is less than the sum of the intermediate genes and their distance (∵ double crossover)

> ② 1 cM (centi-Mogan) **:** Lead distance with 1% crossing rate

> ③ At values below 25 cM, there is almost a proportional relationship between recombination frequency and guidance distance, but above that, the crossover rate is lower than that of guidance distance (e.g. double crossing).

⑹ Difference **:** When one gene affects the phenotype of another gene

> ① Fur color 9 **:** 3 **:** 4

>> ○ Pigment gene and pigment precipitation gene are involved

>> ○ 9 **:** 3 **:** 3 **:** Pigment precipitation genes from 1 reflect recessive homozygotes 3 and 1 as 4

>> ○ Tip. 12 in any experiment **:** 3 **:** 1, 9 **:** 6 **:** 1, 9 **:** 3 **:** 4, 9 **:** If 7 is observed, the top!

> ② Bogye Gene **:** Non-alleles that complement one another to express one trait

>> ○ A trait if A is dominant than B **:** B trait = 1 **:** Appears as a percentage of 0

>> ○ If A is recessive than B, A trait **:** B trait = 1 **:** Appears as a ratio of 2

> ② Example **:** Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, albinoosis, Tay-Sachs disease, etc.

⑻ Dominant **:** Symptoms often develop late

> ① Genotypes and Traits. ⑺-①)

> ② Example **:** Huntingtons' disease

>> ○ It occurs at 30-40 years old, so it can be transmitted later

⑼ Genome stamping and non-nuclear inheritance

> ① Dielectric Imprinting

>> ○ Phenotypes change depending on which trait is passed from parents

>> ○ Caused by DNA methylation (C base) (mostly due to methylation of CpG islands)  

>> ○ During germ cell generation, all genes are demethylated to release imprinting and remethylated depending on whether they are sperm or ovum

>> ○ Male individuals receiving maternal imprints and heterozygous and recessive traits may show dominant traits due to paternal imprints

>> ○ Example **:** IgF-1 Gene in Mice

>> ○ **Example 1.** IgF-1 Gene in Mice **:** Incidental imprinting insulator methylation → transcription promotion, maternal imprinting promoter methylation → transcription inhibition

>> ○ **Example 2.** Prader-Willi Syndrome and Angelman Syndrome

>>> ○ Recessive traits due to chromosomal deletion and genomic engraving

>>> ○ Prader Willi syndrome **:** Deleting chromosome 15. Non-deleting sites of the maternal chromosome are imprinted due to methylation, preventing the expression of the PWS gene

>>> ○ Angelman syndrome **:** Maternal Chromosome 15 deletion. The non-deleting site of the paternal chromosome is imprinted due to methylation, resulting in no AS gene

> ② Maternal effect **:** Cytoplasmic determinants

>> ○ Proteins needed early in development are transferred from mothers to mRNA because they lack time to transcrib

>> ○ Regardless of germ cell genotype, any cytoplasmic determinant is transferred to germ cells if there is any allele in the maternal line

>> ○ Genotype and phenotype should be considered separately

>>> ○ Example **:** Recessive lethal genotyzygote exists when there is no problem in survival but reproduction is impossible

>> ○ Infer the genotype of the mother from the phenotype of the offspring

>>> ○ If the children are all dominant traits, the mother's genotype is dominant

>>> ○ If the children are all recessive traits, the mother's genotype is recessive

>> ○ Example **:** Early Drosophila, Snail Shell's Right Helix, Left Helix, Moth Larva Eye Color Genetic

> ③ Cytoplasmic inheritance

>> ○ Chromosome inheritance

>> ○ mitochondria genetic **:** Maternal inheritance

>>> ○ Electron Transfer System and ATP Transpeptidase Encode mitochondria DNA

>>> ○ heteroplasmy phenomenon **:** Because mitochondria cooperate with many organelles (mainly the nucleus), children of mothers who are sick are not all sick.

>>> ○ **Problem type 1.** When following the Mendelian Gene when mating with mutants **:** Nuclear DNA abnormalities required for mitochondria function

>>> ○ **Problem type 2.** When following a maternal inheritance when mating with a mutant **:** mitochondria DNA abnormalities

>>> ○ **Problem type 3.** Leaven **:** mitochondria originated from parent

> ④ Sex-controlled inheritance **:** The genes are on the autosomal chromosome but the expression of the genes by sex (eg **:** Change of superiority)

>> ○ **Example 1.** Antler gene is dominant in males. Recessive expression in females

>> ○ **Example 2.** Bald genes are dominant in males encoding 5α-reductase, which converts testosterone to dehydrotestosterone (DHT) (enhancing males). Recessive expression in women

>> ○ Women have thinning hair rather than baldness

> ⑤ Xenia **:** Paternity  

<br>

>> ○ Example **:** Unfertilized bees are male, fertilized bees are female

> ④ Gender conversion

>> ○ Example **:** Some fish have only some individuals turned into males by social cues.

> ⑤ Hermaphrodite

>> ○ Example **:** C. elegans has both male and female reproductive organs

⑵ Sex-related inheritance **:** Genes is sex-related, if cross-crossing results in significant differences

> ① 18 common genes on X and Y chromosomes

> ② Y chromosome-associated gene (Hansung Gene) **:** Very few genes. SRY genes determine sex

>> ○ SRY (Sex Region of Y Chromosome)

>> ○ Drosophila sex determinant is on the X chromosome

>>> ○ DMD gene **:** 2.4 million bp, consisting of more than 70 exons, encoding dystrophin protein

>>> ○ Dystrophin **:** Linkage protein between cytoskeleton and six proteins that regulate calcium ionophore in muscle cell membranes

>>> ○ DMD gene is channel deregulated due to deletion of exon

>> ○ Hemophilia  

> ④ Sex-controlled inheritance (See. 4-⑼) **:** Actually not sex-related 

> ⑤ X inactivation **:** Observed only in mammals

>> ○ Defition **:** Females have two X chromosomes, so inactivating one of them for quantitative compensation

>>> ○ Drosophila and pretty little nematodes double the expression of male X chromosomes for quantitative compensation

>> ○ Barr body **:** Inactivated X chromosome, cause of mosaic pattern (eg **:** Cat pattern)

>>> ○ Only in mammals

>> ○ Leon Hypothesis **:** Female early embryos randomly inactivate one X chromosome in each cell

>>> ○ Depending on the animal, the basoche occurs before or in the eggplant

>>> ○ Inactivation is irreversible but only inactivated during germ cell formation

>>> ○ If you have a basso once **:** All progeny cells produced by somatic cell division are condensed at the same site (eg **:** Cancer cells)

>> ○ Mechanism

>>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Generation of Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) from Xist RNA on X chromosome with inactivation determined

>>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. X chromosome, determined to be activated, methylates Xist RNA to prevent inactivation mechanisms

>>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. RNA transcribed from the Xist binds to the corresponding X chromosome

>>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Blocking transcription of X chromosome, which caused RNA interference and determined inactivation

>>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Xist additionally attaches methyl groups to cytosine (C) and deacetylates histones to condense the chromosome → inhibit transcription

<br>

<br>
