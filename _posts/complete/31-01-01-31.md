## **2.** **Solution**

 ⑴ Initial conditions

 ⑵ **Solution 1**

 ⑶ **Solution 2**

> ① Differentiation operation follows the associative property similar to arithmetic operations.

> ② Commutative property holds for addition.

> ③ Non-commutative property holds for multiplication **:** Changing the order of multiplication results in loss of meaning.

 ⑷ **Solution 3**
