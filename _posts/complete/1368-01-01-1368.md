## **1.** **Conjugation** (conjugated system)

⑴ State where p orbitals overlap continuously with three or more orbitals

<br>

**Figure. 1.** Example of Conjugation **:** C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>

<br>

⑵ Conjugated molecules have electrons located in p orbitals on each atom, leading to greater stability compared to unconjugated molecules

> ① According to [Particle in a Box](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1332), unconjugation lowers the energy of particles.

⑶ Conjugated compounds can interact with low-energy light, absorbing light in the ultraviolet or visible range

> ① Principle of [UV-Vis spectrum](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1404#footnote_link_67_53)

⑷ Structure and Stability (e.g., Diene)

> ① Bond lengths of conjugated dienes

>> ○ C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> double bond length **:** 134 pm

>> ○ CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> single bond length **:** 153 pm

>> ○ CH<sub>2</sub>CHCHCH<sub>2</sub> double bond length **:** 134 pm

>> ○ CH<sub>2</sub>CHCHCH<sub>2</sub> single bond length **:** 148 pm < 153 pm

> ② Stability through hybridization confirmation

>> ○ CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> **:** Each carbon has 25% s-character from sp3 hybridization, leading to larger bond distance → less stable

>> ○ CH<sub>2</sub>CHCHCH<sub>2</sub> **:** Middle carbons have 33% s-character from sp2 hybridization, leading to shorter bond distance → more stable

> ③ Stability through resonance stabilization

## **3\. 4+2 Cycloaddition Reaction** (Diels-Alder Reaction)

⑴ Definition **:** Ring-forming addition reaction between nucleophilic dienes and electrophilic dienophiles

<br>

![image](https://github.com/JB243/jb243.github.io/assets/55747737/cbc631c7-6b9c-462d-9064-3ee5bf2f3747)

**Figure. 5.** Overview of Diels-Alder Reaction

<br>

> ① Favorable enthalpy-wise but unfavorable entropy-wise, allowing the reaction to occur

> ② Conditions **:** Δ, BF<sub>3</sub> (Lewis acid catalyst)

>> ○ Lewis Acid Catalyst **:** Increases electrophilic strength of the dienophile, enhancing reaction rate

⑵ Characteristics

> ① Woodward-Hoffmann rule: Occurs only under thermal conditions and does not react under photochemical conditions.

> ② Frontier molecular orbital theory: The electrons from the HOMO of the diene move to the LUMO of the dienophile, resulting in a reaction.

> ③ However, cyclization can also occur between the LUMO of the diene and the HOMO of the dienophile.

> ④ The reaction is highly reactive, proceeding easily even at temperatures as low as 40°C.

> ⑤ At very high temperatures, the reverse reaction may also occur.

⑶ Diene: Corresponds to the HOMO in the Diels-Alder reaction

> ① **Factor 1.** The reaction is faster with a higher proportion of the s-cis isomer.

>> ○ Reason: The s-trans isomer does not undergo the reaction due to the increased ring strain in the final product, a six-membered ring.

>> ○ However, it is important to consider that the s-cis form is 2-3 kcal/mol less stable than the s-trans form.

>> ○ Example: Cyclopentadiene is fixed in the s-cis form and is therefore very reactive.

> ② **Factor 2.** Diels-Alder reactions are also difficult in structures with diynes.

>> ○ Reason: Because the four-membered ring products are unstable.

> ③ **Factor 3.** As a nucleophile, the faster the reaction speed due to having more electron-donating groups (EDG) and fewer electron-withdrawing groups (EWG), as it makes the molecule more electron-rich.

> ④ **Factor 4.** Diene with steric hindrance reacts faster than those without.

>> ○ For this reason, five-membered rings are highly reactive, whereas six-membered rings react more slowly and reactions in seven-membered rings are almost non-existent.

<br>

⑷ Dienophile **:** Corresponds to LUMO in Diels-Alder Reaction

> ① **Factor 1.** As an electrophile, greater electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) and fewer electron-donating groups (EDG) lead to lower electron density and faster reaction rate

⑸ Stereoselective Reaction **:** Comparison of _endo_ and _exo_

<br>

**Figure. 7.** Stereoselective Reaction in Diels-Alder Reaction

<br>

> ① _endo_ and _exo_ products are partial diastereomers

>> ○ _endo_ arrangement **:** Substituents are oriented toward the larger ring direction around the bridgehead carbon

>>> ○ Strongest EWG on dienophile flips down

>>> ○ Strongest EDG on diene flips up

>> ○ _exo_ arrangement **:** Substituents are oriented toward the smaller ring direction around the bridgehead carbon

> ② Reaction rate-wise, _endo_ product is dominant due to the stability difference of the transition state

<br>

**Figure. 8.** Difference in Orbital Interaction between _exo_ and _endo_ in Diels-Alder Reaction

<br>

>> ○ At low temperatures (25 ℃), _endo_ product is the major product

>> ○ _exo_ transition state **:** Only primary interactions exist

>> ○ _endo_ transition state **:** Both primary and secondary interactions exist

>> ○ Even in non-cyclic compounds, _endo_ product is predominant

> ③ Thermodynamically, _exo_ product is predominant

>> ○ Reason **:** Lesser steric hindrance with substituents in the smaller ring direction

>> ○ At high temperatures (90 ℃), _exo_ product is the major product

>> ○ Reason **:** Reaction rate-dominant products can undergo reverse reaction to become reactants again

> ④ Exception

>> ○ When the dienophile is an alkene, the substituent orientation of the product conforms to the general alkene bonding positions, not _endo_ or _exo_

⑹ Position-Selective Reaction (ortho-para rule)

> ① Definition **:** A rule stating that the EDG of the diene and the EWG of the dienophile in the final product should be oriented in the _ortho_ or _para_ direction

> ② _ortho_ orientation reaction

**Figure. 12.** Understanding of diene and dienophile in _para_ orientation

<br>

> ④ Reason **:** Favorable overlap of p orbitals between carbon with partial negative charge due to EDG and carbon with partial positive charge due to EWG
