## **1. essence of error**  

⑴ measure**:** determination of measured values in strictly defined units

⑵ error = measured Value - true value

⑶ the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics makes it impossible to know the true value of any measurement

⑷ since the true value is not accurate, it is reasonable that the error is considered to be a specific range rather than a specific value. related to probability error

<br>

## **2. types of error** 

⑴ unfair error

> ① definition **:** errors that occur when a measurement is unreliable due to an apparent error in instrument operation 

> ② **example 1.** if one origin is not set when measuring length

> ③ **example 2.** if the resistance measurement does not confirm the origin

> ④ solution: since the cause is obvious, we should neglect the data 

>> ○ if these are included, the reliability of other measurements is poor.

⑵ systematic error

> ① definition**:** error due to unstable measuring instrument.

> ② characteristic**:** it can estimate the size and sign and **correct** the error 

> ③ **example 1.** the case in which the average value was obtained by measuring the voltage several times, and as a result of checking, the scale of the voltmeter used deviated from its origin

> ④ **example 2.** the case in which the length was measured with a ruler, but the change in length with temperature was not considered

> ⑤ **example 3.** truncation error**:** error caused by taking only a specific term from a solution expressed in series (_e.g._, Taylor series)

⑶ random error

> ① definition **:** an error due to fluctuations in measurements that result from different results of repeated measurements

> ② solution **:** use a more precise measuring instrument or repeat several times

> ③ reducing random error is the most important factor in improving experimental results

⑷ probable error

> ① definition**:** the size of error assumed when acquiring measured value 

> ② it's not the cause of the error, but how to express it 

> ③ it is represented by σp and used in a way of "measured value x = x<sub>avg</sub> ± σ<sub>p</sub>" 

>> ○ it doesn't mean that the error of x is σ<sub>p</sub> 

>> ○ it means that the probability of x deviating more than ±σ<sub>p</sub> is small 

>> ○ set σ<sub>p</sub> so that the probability that the true value is between x<sub>avg</sub> - σ<sub>p</sub> and x<sub>avg</sub> + σ<sub>p</sub> is 50%

> ④ errors are normally distributed, and if the standard deviation of the error is σm, the probability that the true value is between x<sub>avg</sub> - σ<sub>m</sub> and x<sub>avg</sub> + σ<sub>m</sub> is approximately 68 %

> ⑤ if we set σ<sub>p</sub> = 0.67 σ<sub>m</sub>, the probability that true value is between x<sub>avg</sub> - σ<sub>p</sub> and x<sub>avg</sub> + σ<sub>p</sub> is 50%

## **3. significant figure of measured values** 

⑴ necessity **:** all measurements are approximated, so the measurements should only show valid numbers, _i.e._ only significant figure

⑵ rules for significant figure selection 

> ① the leftmost number other than 0 is the highest significant figure 

> ② if there is no decimal point, the rightmost number other than 0 is the lowest significant figure 

> ③ if you have a decimal point, even if the number on the far right is 0, this number is the lowest significant figure 

> ④ all numbers between the highest and lowest significant figures are also significant figures 

> ⑤ example**:** only the underlined part is the significant figure 

>> ○ <u>994.29</u>

>> ○ <u>56</u>000

>> ○ 0.00<u>48</u>

>> ○ <u>6.000</u> 

>> ○ <u>800.</u> 

>> ○ <u>2.990</u> × 10<sup>4</sup> 

⑶ rules for significant figure calculation**:** reducing waste of unnecessary calculation time when calculating measurements

> ① addition and subtraction**:** if we calculate the summation of 7.9 and 0.1637,

>> ○ the number 7.9 has no significant number at two decimal places, so 0.1637 is cut there → 0.16

>> ○ 7.9 + 0.16 = 8.06 

>> ○ if you round it up to one decimal place, 8.06 → **8.1** 

> ② multiplication and division**:** if you calculate the product of 7.9 and 0.1637,

>> ○ 7.9 × 0.1637 = 1.29323

>> ○ 7.9 has two significant figures and 0.1637 has four significant figures, so you can round the results to two digits

>> ○ 1.29323 → **1.3** 

<br>

<br>

## **4. standard error**  

⑴ necessity **:** measured values have some distribution due to random error → a number that can represent them is required

⑵ **type 1. mode :** the most frequently measured value

⑶ **type 2. median :** measurements placed in the center when the data are listed in order of size

⑷ **type 3.** average (mean)**:** the arithmetic mean of the measured values

> ① when the N measurements are said x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ···, and x<sub>N</sub>,

> ② if the frequencies of each measured value x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ···,  and x<sub>N</sub> are f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>, ···, and f<sub>N</sub> respectively,

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ctDD1K/btrtRXaU7xu/PabiANdAgc4p6EBSmkOJzk/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

> ③ calculation of variance σ<sup>2</sup>

> ④ if the physical quantity per round is measured M times, the average value and standard deviation of the measured values obtained each round are different

> ⑤ if the standard deviation of the sample mean x<sub>avg</sub> is σ<sub>m</sub>, the following relationship is established between σ, σ<sub>m</sub>, and N

>> ○ σ<sub>m</sub> is also referred to as standard error

> ⑥ the measurements to be reported from the measurement data are as follows.

>> x = x<sub>avg</sub> ± σ<sub>m</sub>

> ⑦ in general physics experiments, it is common to report a measurement using a probability error that sets the confidence coefficient to 50%

>> x = x<sub>avg</sub> ± σ<sub>p</sub> = x<sub>avg</sub> ± 0.6745σ<sub>m</sub>

> ⑧ how to depict an error

>> ○ absolute error**:** report in the form of σ 

>> ○ relative error**:** report in the form of <span>σ ／ |x<sub>avg</sub>| </span>

>> ○ percent error**:** report in the form of <span>σ ／ |x<sub>avg</sub>| × 100 </span>

<br>

<br>

## **5. propagation of error**  

⑴ example**:** an experiment to find out the volume of a cube

> ① **method 1.** obtaining data on 1,000 volumes and calculating the mean value and standard deviation

> ② **method 2.** calculating the volume by multiplying each average value for width, length, and height first and multiplying these average values

> ③ **method 2** is much more convenient, but errors are accumulated.

⑵ propagation theory of errors

> ① assume that a physical quantity z is given as a relation of another physical quantity x, y, ··· in a way of z = f(x, y, ···)

> ② assume that the mean values (sample mean) of xavg, yavg, ··· and the standard deviation σ<sub>x</sub>, σ<sub>y</sub>, σ<sub>z</sub> were obtained from the measurements of x, y, ··· 

> ③ mean of the z, _i.e._ z<sub>avg</sub>

>> z<sub>avg</sub> = f(x= f(x<sub>avg</sub>, y, y<sub>avg</sub>, ···), ···)

> ④ standard deviation of z, _i.e._ σ<sub>z</sub>

> ⑤ (∂f／∂x)<sub>0</sub>, ,(∂f／∂y)<sub>0</sub>, ··· means partial derivatives calculated from the average values of x<sub>avg</sub>, y<sub>avg</sub>, ···

⑶ propagation formula of errors 

> ① z = ax ± by

> ② z = axy

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/uG0uw/btrtTMtsQQI/vcvyAoGPrzNRojgZ3Wy5oK/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

> ③ z = ax／y

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bygjfi/btrtTLOPzi2/JqzgoOCF0G2gfPDtfKiLqk/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

> ④ z = ax<sup>b</sup>

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bPFhpS/btrtYUqedEE/xYEDlavdQv8IiT6weO5mwk/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

> ⑤ z = ae<sup>bx</sup>

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/YgbyT/btrtVpEOqZQ/93XYJIzJkIBoart0gHVdN0/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

> ⑥ z = a log(bx) 

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dD1ucg/btrtXynMSSe/2e873PjbL1vrkOUoFd3eo1/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

⑷ suggestion 

> ①  rules for significant figure calculation stem from the propagation formula of errors.

> ② in the case of the power function, the larger the exponent, the larger the propagating error, so a particularly precise measurement is required

<br>

<br>

## **6. least square method** 

⑴ most probable value**:** representative value that minimizes the sum of the squares of the deviation.

⑵ least square method

> ① assume that x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ···, x<sub>N</sub> are obtained from the repetitive measurements of an amount

> ② if the most probable value is x, the sum of the squares of the deviation is as follows

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dlQBmd/btrtYUqeEOQ/9HktzZceIdr0D8ecxw3540/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

> ③ this is considered a function of x, and the condition under which this function has a minimum value is as follows

<br><center><img src="https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/di2n6T/btrtYVCG2Ft/7dvnz0qi5DPwkZk03cPyS1/img.png" alt="drawing" /></center><br>

> ④ in this particular condition, the mose probable value is the same with the mean value 

⑶ it's often used to find polynomial trend lines
