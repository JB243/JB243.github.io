## **1\. Characteristics**

 ⑴ Multicellular Eukaryotic Organisms

> ① Exception **:** Yeast

> ② Multinucleate Fungi → Septa → Multicellular Mycelium

 ⑵ Lack Chlorophyll, Depend on Heterotrophic Nutrition

> ① Extracellular Digestion **:** Absorption through Hyphae

> ② **Symbiosis 1.** Lichen-forming Fungi **:** Symbiosis with Algae (Plants), Cyanobacteria (Bacteria), and Green Algae (Protists)

> ③ **Symbiosis 2.** Mycorrhizae **:** Fungi + Plants (Eukaryotic)

 ⑶ Composed of Mycelium **:** Body, Reproductive Structures

> ① Mycelium **:** Structure formed by elongated cells resembling threads

> ② Aggregation of Mycelium forms Mycelial Structure

 ⑷ Cell Organelles

> ① Cell Organelles are enclosed by the Cell Membrane

> ② Cell Membrane **:** Composed of Ergosterol

> ③ Cell Wall **:** Composed of Chitin, Glucan

 ⑸ Classification Based on Presence of Septa

> ① Septa **:** Walls between cells, containing pores large enough for nuclei to pass through

> ② Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota **:** No Septa

> ③ Ascomycota **:** Partial Septa

> ④ Basidiomycota **:** Septa Present

 ⑹ Production of Useful Substances like Antibiotics

## **2\. Life Cycle**

 ⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Plasmodium (n)

 ⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. (+) Mating Type (n) and (-) Mating Type (n) Fuse to Form Diploid Nucleus (2n)

 ⑶ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Spore (n) Formation

> ① Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota **:** Diploid → Fusion → Meiosis

> ② Ascomycota **:** Diploid → Cell Division → Fusion → Meiosis, 8 Spores / Ascus

> ③ Basidiomycota **:** Diploid → Cell Division → Fusion → Meiosis, 4 Spores / Basidium

 ⑷ 4<sup>th</sup>. Spore (n) Mitosis → Formation of Plasmodium (n)

## **3\. Classification**

 ⑴ Chytridiomycota (Chytrids)

> ① Earliest Fungi

> ② Zoospores (Animal-like Spores)

 ⑵ Zygomycota (Zygomycetes) (e.g., Bread Molds)

> ① Aseptate Hyphae

> ② Sexual Reproduction produces Zygosporangium

> ③ Zygospore **:** Result of Plasmogamy of Zygote (2n)

 ⑶ Mycorrhizae

> ① Symbiosis with Plants

> ② Ectomycorrhizae **:** Observed in 10% of Plants

>> ○ Ectomycorrhizal Hyphae form a tough mantle over the root surface

>> ○ Some Hyphae penetrate the outer cells of the root but do not enter the cell walls

> ③ Endomycorrhizae **:** Observed in 85% of Plants

>> ○ Endomycorrhizal Hyphae grow into the root and do not form a mantle

>> ○ Some Hyphae penetrate root cells, but not the cell membrane

> ④ Mycorrhiza → Plant **:** Mycorrhiza provides Plants with nutrients like NO3- or H2PO4-

> ⑤ Plant → Mycorrhiza **:** Plants provide Mycorrhiza with photosynthesis products, such as sugars

 ⑷ Ascomycota (Sac Fungi) (e.g., Yeasts, Molds)

> ① Ascocarp (n) develops during Sexual Reproduction

> ② Ascospores **:** Spores formed within the Ascus (n)

> ③ Conidiospores: Used during Asexual Reproduction, while Ascospores are used during Sexual Reproduction

> ④ Yeasts can form Ascospores under unfavorable conditions

> ⑤ Symbiosis with Algae

 ⑸ Basidiomycota (Club Fungi) (e.g., Mushrooms)

> ① Aggregated Mycelium forms Basidiocarp, Basidiospores formed in Basidium

> ② Basidiospores **:** Spores formed within Basidium on the Basidiocarp

> ③ Decompose Lignin in Wood for Survival

> ④ Dikaryotic Mycelium divides to form Mushroom, Basidium
