To become a lighthouse for those who have lost their way on my rough journey.

<br>

## **1\. Cause**

 ⑴ Unable to find suitable major and PI for myself

 ⑵ Strategy misstep focusing on fields I like, excel in, and should do, resulting in a somewhat misplaced Statement of Purpose (SOP)

> ① Reasons for choosing microbiology major in previous study abroad application

>> ○ Felt potential in food (white bio) and environmental (green bio) research instead of medical (red bio)

>> ○ Ability to validate various hypotheses and theories through microorganisms

>> ○ Confusion between metagenomics and microbiology

>> ○ Fit didn't align well, however

 ⑶ Mistake of applying to departments that don't select foreign students or have limited intake

 ⑷ Obsession with a uniform academic plan instead of preparing a department-specific one

 ⑸ Failed to implement strategic support like upward application, pre-contacts, and networking

 ⑹ Some bad luck as well: Unable to identify the reason for rejection from Scripts Research Institute, which still has a considerably high interview acceptance rate

 ⑺ Not the cause: Publications, patents, experience, and recommenders

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Opportunity**

 ⑴ [Portrai](https://portrai.io/)

 ⑵ [Higher Education Foundation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2214)

 ⑶ [Blog](https://jb243.github.io/0242-01-01-0242.html): Also served as a positive factor for successful pre-contacts

<br>

<br>

## **3\. Strategy**

 ⑴ ✅ Focusing on the US and applying parallel to European universities **:** Considering UK, Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden.

> ① Marketing theory suggests sending letters up to 3 times to the same person

> ② Aiming for at least 5 successful pre-contact cases 

> ③ Pre-contact History

>> ○ 23.04.03 → fail 

>> ○ 23.04.05 → success (WashU)

>> ○ 23.04.10 → fail

>> ○ Since the deadline for a significant number of CS programs is December 15th (local time), the Big Data Analysis Engineer certification, with its results coming out slightly earlier, can be effectively leveraged as an achievement.

> ④ ✅ [GRE Physics](https://achievements.gre.org/c8db3de3-c41b-4d1c-96e1-7b87f8f6d344#gs.76ra8y) (23.10.08) **:** It's classified as a certificate

## **4\. Additional Plans for the Year**

 ⑴ Completion of in-house major project

> ① Project start date: 23.03.06

> ② Project renewal: 23.08.24

⑵ Preparation for acquiring a technical qualification

> ① Possible time for technical qualification exam: First half of 2025

> ② ✅ Big Data Analysis Engineer Written Exam (23.09.23) → Passed Written Exam (23.10.06) → Advanced Exam (23.12.02)

 ⑶ ✅ **Translating the Blog:** Releasing 200 posts within the year

> ① ✅ **Step 1:** Establishing a fully integrated GitHub ↔︎ Tistory system (23.06.06)

> ② ✅ **Step 2:** [Translation Project Completed](https://jb243.github.io/pages/notice/1758#footnote_link_67_54) (23.08.17): Python crawling → Markdown conversion → ChatGPT API → GitHub commit

>> ○ Python crawling: Using Python requests library

>> ○ Markdown conversion: Using BeautifulSoup library

>> ○ ChatGPT API: Need for [text preprocessing](https://jb243.github.io/pages/325#footnote_link_67_50) due to the decline in translation quality with lengthy instructions

> ③ ✅ **Step 3:** Considering introducing LLaMa2 (late 2023 ~ early 2024)

>> ○ Advantage (vs. ChatGPT2): It's installed, so it's free and has a reproducibility. Enables more efficient fine-tuning. [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) makes the use of llama2 a lot easier.

>> ○ Remark (vs. ChatGPT2): Using the LLaMa2 API key also incurs costs ([Replicate](https://replicate.com/pricing))

> ④ Direction of the translation project: Envisioning a system where making changes on the original site triggers changes on all other foreign language sites

>> ○ Other foreign language sites: Established or planned to be established on GitHub. Languages include English, Japanese, Spanish, etc.

>> ○ **Step 1:** Make edits on the original site (e.g., Tistory)

>> ○ **Step 2:** Detect modification events in JavaScript and transmit to the LLaMa2-based AI assistant

>> ○ **Step 3:** LLaMa2-based AI assistant sends commands to internal server to execute Git Clone and Git Commit

>> ○ **Step 4:** All other foreign language GitHub sites are changed collectively

>> ○ In the future, LLM is expected to evolve through projects like this AI assistant project

⑷ ✅ **Profiting the Blog:** Establishment of a publishing company

> ① Establishment of Izgrimean (izgrimean) Publishing: 23.06.07

⑸ ✅ **Animating the Blog:** Establishment of a YouTube channel 

> ① Establishment of a YouTube channel: 23.08.29

## **5\. Passage that Inspired Me to Rise Again**

<br>

> ○ [Admiral McRaven Leaves the Audience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBuIGBCF9jc)

>> ○ What starts here changes the world.

>> ○ You will fail. You will likely fail often. It will be painful. It will be discouraging at times. It will test you to your very core. But if you want to change the world, don't be afraid of them.

>> ○ There are a lot of sharks in the world. If you hope to complete the swim, you will have to deal with them. So if you want to change the world, don't back down from the sharpest. 

>> ○ At the darkest moment of the mission is a time when you need to be calm. When you must be calm. When you must be composed. When all your tactical skills, your physical power and your inner strength must be brought to bear. If you want to change the world, you must be your very best in the darkest moments. 

>> ○ One person can change the world by giving people hope. So if you want to change the world, start singing when you're up to your neck in mud. 

>> ○ All you have to do to quit is ring the bell. Ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at 5 o' clock. Ring the bell and you no longer have to be in the freezing cold swims. Ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs the obstacle course, the PT and you no longer endure the hardships of training. All you have to do is ring the bell to get out. If you want to change the world, don't ever ever ring the bell.

<br>

> ○ **[Elon Musk Motivational Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U5dEdWouDY&t=291s)**

>> ○ I think failure is bad. I don’t think it’s good.

<br>

> ○ **[Failure Motivational Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dww3Oo8ropA&t=210s)**

>> ○ You know it's always a little bit frustrating to me when people have a negative relationship with failure.

>> ○ Fail early, fail often, fail forward.
