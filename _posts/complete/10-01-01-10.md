## **4\. d'Arsonval Meter**

 ⑴ Overview

 d’Arsonval meter is an instrument where the needle rotates proportionally to the flowing current. If the rated current is 1 mA and the rated voltage is 50 mV, when 1 mA flows through the meter, the voltage drop across the meter is 50 mV, and the needle points to full scale. (Thus, resistance = 50 Ω)

 ⑵ Mechanical Mechanism of d'Arsonval Meter Movement

**Figure. 15.** Structure of a d'Arsonval Meter

> The mechanical mechanism of the d'Arsonval meter utilizes Lorentz force. A constant magnetic field is provided by a permanent magnet. When current passes through the moving coil, torque is generated, causing the pointer to rotate clockwise. Control springs above and below, however, provide counteracting torque, resulting in an equilibrium state. The value read from the meter represents this equilibrium state.

**Figure. 16.** Structure of a d'Arsonval Meter

**Figure. 17.** Structure of a d'Arsonval Meter

> Looking more closely, even a small angle of movement of the moving coil quickly points the pointer to full scale. The direction of the moving coil's plane vector (pointer direction) is relatively perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. For further analysis, refer to the following diagram.

**Figure. 18.** Conceptual Diagram of a d'Arsonval Meter

> The Lorentz force acts in the direction of the red arrow in this case. (Lorentz forces in other wires cancel out.) Thus, torque causes the pointer to rotate clockwise. The degree of freedom from above is as follows.

**Figure. 19.** Conceptual Diagram of a d'Arsonval Meter

> The sizes of the red arrows marked here are labeled as Bil. The blue arrow represents the torque of the control spring, with a size of κ(θ0 \- θ). (θ0 is the initial angle of the pointer.) Therefore, the following equation can be established.

> Here, I is the inertia moment of the d'Arsonval meter, a purely mechanical element. While it's difficult to solve this equation completely, it can be inferred that it undergoes simple harmonic motion.

 However, due to friction, the amplitude of this motion will gradually decrease. As a result, it will reach an equilibrium state, where the right side of the equation becomes 0.

> Considering the angle θ ranges around 90 degrees, the following equation is derived. Note that the value we read from the meter is θ0 \- θ. Be aware that beyond the full scale, the meter's reading is not linear with the current.

 ⑶ Voltmeter

> ① Construction

**Figure. 20.** Voltmeter Construction

>> The properties of the core's material determine the rated current and voltage of the d'Arsonval meter. Consequently, the internal resistance Rv of the d'Arsonval meter is limited. Therefore, voltmeters are constructed in the manner shown above. When voltage V is applied across the terminals, the voltage across the d'Arsonval meter is as follows.

>> Thus, this system has a rated current of 1 mA, and the rated voltage is as follows. In other words, this system linearly displays voltages from 0 V to the mentioned voltage. (Different resistances are required for each full-scale count.)

> ② Circuit Connection

>> ○ Connect in parallel to the terminals being measured

>> ○ Always consider the internal resistance of the voltmeter **:** Note that the internal resistance of the voltmeter is very high

>> ○ All resistances connected in parallel have the same voltage

 ⑷ Ammeter

> ① Construction

**Figure. 22.** Ammeter Construction

>> The properties of the core's material determine the rated current and voltage of the d'Arsonval meter. Consequently, the internal resistance Rv of the d'Arsonval meter is limited. Therefore, ammeters are constructed in the manner shown above. When voltage V is applied across the terminals, the voltage across the d'Arsonval meter is V. Additionally, the total current flowing through the terminals is as follows.

>> Thus, this system has a rated voltage of 50 mV, and the rated current is as follows. In other words, this system linearly displays currents from 0 A to the mentioned current. (Different resistances are required for each full-scale count.)

> ② Circuit Connection

>> ○ Open the terminals to be measured and connect the ammeter in series

>> ○ Always consider the internal resistance of the ammeter **:** Note that the internal resistance of the ammeter is very low

>> ○ All resistances connected in series have the same current

 ⑸ Types of d'Arsonval Meters

> ① Digital Multimeter (DMM)

>> ○ Measures voltage, current, resistance, etc.

>> ○ Typically has an internal resistance of 10 to 11 MΩ

>> ○ LCD Display **:** Long operation (2,000 hours or more, 9V), hard to see in the dark, slow response

>> ○ LED Display **:** Short-term operation, visible even in the dark, high response

>> ○ Capacitance meter **:** Measures capacitance C, considering polarity. If the capacitor is deteriorated, its resistance decreases and can be detected by a regular resistance meter

 ⑹ Resolution and Accuracy

> ① Resolution

>> ○ Most DMMs can display 3 digits and 1 decimal point (period)

>> ○ 3 ½ digits, 4½ digits, 8½ digits are also available

>> ○ Smaller measurement values have better resolution

>> ○ Example **:** Up to 1.999 V, resolution is 0.001 V, from 2.00 V, resolution is 0.01 V

> ② Accuracy

>> ○ Ordinary DMMs have accuracy from 0.01% to 0.5%

>> ○ High-performance DMMs can have accuracy as low as 0.002%
