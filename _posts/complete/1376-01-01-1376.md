## **1\. Nomenclature**

⑴ Oxa Type

> ① Named as cycloalkane at the end

> ② Oxygen forming the ring is labeled as 1

> ③ The carbon with the most substituents is labeled as 2, and if the numbers are the same, alphabetical order is followed

⑵ Oxirane Type

> ① Named as oxirane at the end

> ② Oxygen forming the ring is labeled as 1

> ③ The carbon with the most substituents is labeled as 2, and if the numbers are the same, alphabetical order is followed

> ④ Example **:** 2-methyl-3-phenyloxirane

⑶ Epoxyalkane Type

> ① Terminal carbon is labeled as 1

> ② If connected to the 3rd and 4th carbons, named as 3,4-epoxy-

> ③ Substituents are named in alphabetical order after the numbers are determined

⑷ Alkene Oxide Type

> ① Terminal carbon of the alkene is numbered to have the lower number

> ② Substituents are named in alphabetical order after the numbers are determined

## **2\. Reactions**

⑴ Overview

> ① Ring-opening reactions

> ② Epoxides are more reactive than ethers due to ring strain

⑵ Acid-Catalyzed Ring-Opening Reaction **:** Proceeds similar to S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction

> ① Mechanism

<br>

> ② **(Formula)** Can be understood as an S<sub>N</sub>1-like reaction where initially, oxygen captures a proton, creating a carbocation on the carbon with more substitution

⑶ Base-Catalyzed Ring-Opening Reaction **:** Proceeds similar to S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction

> ① Mechanism

<br>

> ② **(Formula)** Strong nucleophile attacks, avoiding steric hindrance

⑷ Fürst-Plattner Rule 

> ① For cyclic carbon compounds, the ring opens such that the -OH group and the nucleophile become trans axial.

> ② The ring opens in the direction of chair conformation's twofold axis, not in the direction of twist boat conformation's twofold axis

> ③ Reason for _trans_ axial conformation **:** Related to backside attack

> ① Mechanism
