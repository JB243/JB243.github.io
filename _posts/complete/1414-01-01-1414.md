## **A. 1.**

The nitrogen atoms in both piperidinium and aziridinium are sp3 hybridized. According to VSEPR theory, sp3 hybridization indicates a bond angle of 109.5°. Piperidinium can be bent into a chair form to forcefully match this bond angle, but aziridinium cannot achieve a 109.5° bond angle in its triangular shape with an internal angle of 60°. According to [VSEPR theory](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1330), the N-C and C-C bonds in aziridinium attempt to adjust the bond angle away from the bonding lines.

However, even loose σ bonds seem unable to satisfy the 109.5° bond angle. So, nature uses a different technique. As is well known, sp3 hybrid orbitals predict a bond angle of 109.5°, sp2 hybrid orbitals predict 120°, and sp hybrid orbitals predict 180°. This means that the larger the p-character, the smaller the bond angle. The N-C and C-C bonds in aziridinium have more p-character allocated. Since the N assigns more p-character to its bonds with carbon, it allocates more s-character to its N-H bond. Therefore, the lone pair on the conjugate base R-NH- is more stabilized, resulting in higher acidity.

## **Q. 2.**

Which molecule has a longer C-H bond, cyclopentane or cyclohexane?

## **A. 2.**

The same logic as the first question applies. Cyclopentane experiences bond angle strain and thus allocates more than 75% p-character to the C-C bond. Consequently, more s-character is allocated to the C-H bond. Therefore, cyclohexane, with less s-character allocated to the C-H bond, has a longer bond length.

<br>

<br>

## **Q. 3.**

Which has a longer C=O bond, cyclopropanone or cyclohexanone?

<br>

## **A. 3.**

The same logic as the first question applies. Cyclopropanone experiences bond angle strain and thus allocates more than 75% p-character to the C-C bond. Consequently, more s-character is allocated to the C=O bond. Therefore, cyclohexanone, with less s-character allocated to the C=O bond, has a longer bond length.
