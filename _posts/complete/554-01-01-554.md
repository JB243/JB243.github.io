⑴ How to Introduce External DNA into Cells

> ① Transformation: CaCl<sub>2</sub> transformation, etc.

> ② Transduction: How DNA is injected into cell lines through viruses such as phage  

> ③ Transfection: Injecting DNA Directly into Cell Lines

> ④ Conjugation  

> ⑤ Electroporation  

> ⑥ Microinjection

> ⑦ Gene gun

> ⑧ Protoplast formation: Yeast, Plant Cell Protoplast  

⑵ Transformation: The process of changing the genotype and phenotype of a bacterium by taking in DNA from another individual from the outside environment

> ① Experimenter should make competent cell which is easy to bind microorganism with DNA

> ② Gene Mapping Through Transformation: At the same time, the closer you are to trigger a transformation,

⑶ Transduction: The process by which bacteriophages transfer genes from one host bacterium to another

> See. Generally toxic phage, in certain cases moderate phage

> ① 1<sup>st</sup>. Phage will infect some bacteria. This bacterium becomes a donor cell

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup>. Phage DNA is replicated, and cells synthesize large quantities of proteins encoding from phage genes

>> ○ Phage protein prevents the synthesis of proteins encoded by the host cell

>> ○ DNA of host cell is cut off

> ③ 3<sup>rd</sup>. When new phage particles are assembled, bacterial DNA fragments containing specific alleles may be packaged in the phage capsid.

> ④ 4<sup>th</sup>. When the phage carrying the allele infects the receptor bacteria, recombination occurs between the donor and recipient cells. This process is a homologous recombination similar to the crossover phenomenon.

> ⑤ 5<sup>th</sup>. As a result, the genotype of the recombinant cell may be different from that of the donor or the receptor.  

> ⑥ Genetic maps can be created by transduction

⑷ Join: Direct transfer of genetic material between two adjacent bacteria

> ① F plasmid

>> ○ F plasmid: Consists of 25 genes, most of which are needed for sexually transmitted mothers

>> ○ Donor cell (F<sup>+</sup>) if bearing F plasmid, otherwise receptor cell (F<sup>-</sup>)

>> ○ F<sup>+</sup> delivers F plasmid to F<sup>-</sup> to form F<sup>+</sup>

> ② Common Donor Strain Conjugation: Genetic transfer through the gonadotum from donor cells to receptor cells  

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. F<sup>+</sup> cells form a junction with F<sup>-</sup> cells and one strand of plasmid is broken

>>> ○ Conditions of Receptor Cells: rec+

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Using unbroken strands as templates, cells form new strands

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. In the meantime, the broken strands come off and one end enters the F\- cell.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Plasmids are circularly linked in receptor cells

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Receptor cells also become F+ cells

>>> ○ Junction pathways fall off before the entire chromosome and the remaining F factor are fully delivered

>>>> See. When the receptor cell holds some of the DNA of the donor cell

>>> ○ F plasmids are rarely delivered last to become F+ cells

>> ○ Disadvantages: Extremely low frequency

> ③ High Frequency Recombinant Strain Conjugation

>> ○ High Frequency Recombination (Hfr) Donor Cells: Strain with F Factor Inserted into Chromosome DNA (Bac)

>>> ○ F plasmid randomly inserted into the genome

>>> ○ Solve the low frequency problem of F<sup>+</sup>-F<sup>-</sup> junctions

>> ○ Passing F-plasmid and Chromosome Particles → DNA Recombination in Bacteria

>> ○ The F factor is passed last; Rotational direction of rotation (clock, counterclockwise) depends on the relative position

## **3\. Mobility DNA**

⑴ Summary

> ① Mobile DNA contains transposons and retrotranspozones

>> ○ Transposon: Cut and paste

>> ○ Retrotransposon: Copy and paste

> ② Movable DNA can be mutagenic

⑵ Composition of transposon

> ① Insertion sequence is located at both ends. Antibiotic resistance gene may be located in the center

> ② Potential factor: DNA that moves substantially

> ③ Insertion sequence: 2500 base pairs or less. Consists of two parts

>> ○ Transposase: Catalyzing the insertion of genes elsewhere

>> ○ Reverse iteration sequence: Sequences at both ends of the transposon. Same as each other but in opposite direction. 20-40 nucleotides

> ① DS is a factor without translocation enzyme gene in Ac

> ② Ds is transferred by Ac and overlaid on the genetic code of gene C

> ③ Ac metastasizes itself and overwrites the genetic code at gene C sites

> ④ The size of the spot on the spotted grain is related to the point at which the dislocation occurred during development.

⑵ The plasma membranes are interconnected.

⑶ Plant viruses move to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata.
