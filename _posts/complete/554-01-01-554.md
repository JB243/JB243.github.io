> ⑧ Protoplast formation: Yeast, plant cell protoplast  

⑵ Transformation: The process by which a bacterium takes up DNA from its external environment, resulting in changes to its genotype and phenotype.

> ① The experimenter must prepare the microorganism as a competent cell to facilitate DNA binding.

> ② [Genome maps](https://jb243.github.io/pages/75) can be constructed through transformation: the closer the genes are located, the more likely they are to undergo simultaneous transformation.

⑶ Transduction: The process by which a bacteriophage transfers genes from one host bacterium to another.

> ① Typically, lytic phages are used, but lysogenic phages can be used in specific cases.  

> ② 1<sup>st</sup>. A phage infects a bacterium, which then becomes the donor cell.  

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup>. The phage DNA replicates, and the cell synthesizes large amounts of proteins encoded by the phage genes.  

>> ○ During this time, phage proteins prevent the host cell from synthesizing proteins encoded by its own DNA.  

>> ○ The host cell's DNA is fragmented.  

> ④ 3<sup>rd</sup>. When new phage particles are assembled, fragments of bacterial DNA containing specific host genes may sometimes be packaged into the phage capsid.  

> ⑤ 4<sup>th</sup>. When a phage carrying this bacterial DNA infects a recipient bacterium, recombination occurs between the donor and recipient cells. This process is homologous recombination, similar to crossing-over.  

> ⑥ 5<sup>th</sup>. As a result, the genotype of the recombinant cell may differ from both the donor and the recipient cells.  

> ⑦ [Genome maps](https://jb243.github.io/pages/75) can be constructed through transduction.  

⑷ Conjugation: The phenomenon in which genetic material is directly transferred between two temporarily adjacent bacteria.

> ① Plasmid: A small circular DNA molecule used by bacteria to share antibiotic resistance information.

> ② F plasmid

>> ○ F Plasmid: Composed of 25 genes, most of which are required for sex pilus formation (e.g., tra genes).

>> ○ A cell possessing the F plasmid is referred to as a donor cell (F<sup>+</sup>), while a cell without it is referred to as a recipient cell (F<sup>-</sup>).

>> ○ F<sup>+</sup> cells transfer the F plasmid to F<sup>-</sup> cells, converting them into F<sup>+</sup> cells.

> ③ General donor strain conjugation: Genetic material is transferred from a donor cell to a recipient cell via a sex pilus.

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. The F<sup>+</sup> cell forms a conjugation bridge with the F<sup>-</sup> cell, and one strand of the plasmid is cleaved.

>>> ○ Condition for recipient cell: Must be rec<sup>+</sup>.

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Using the unbroken strand as a template, the donor cell synthesizes a new complementary strand.

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. In the meantime, the cleaved strand detaches and one end enters the F<sup>-</sup> cell.

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. In the recipient cell, the plasmid strand is connected to itself to form a complete circular plasmid.

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. The recipient cell becomes an F<sup>+</sup> cell.

>>> ○ The conjugation bridge usually breaks before the entire chromosome and remaining F factor are fully transferred.

>>>> ○ It is when the recipient cell retains some of the donor cell's DNA.

>>> ○ Since the F plasmid is transferred last, it is rare for an F<sup>-</sup> cell to become an F<sup>+</sup> cell.

>> ○ Drawback: The frequency of this process is extremely low.

> ③ High frequency recombinant strain conjugation

>> ○ High-frequency recombination (Hfr) donor cell: A bacterial strain in which the F factor is integrated into the chromosomal DNA (Bac).  

>>> ○ The F plasmid is randomly inserted into the genome.  

>>> ○ Resolves the low-frequency issue of F<sup>+</sup>-F<sup>-</sup> conjugation.  

>> ○ Transfers both the F plasmid and parts of the chromosome, leading to bacterial DNA recombination.  

>> ○ The F factor is transferred last, and the unwinding direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) varies depending on its relative position.  

> ④ Interrupted mating technique: Applied in constructing genome maps.
