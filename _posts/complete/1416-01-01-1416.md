## **0\. Overview**

> Proteins are used as energy when there is no carbohydrate.

<br>

<br>


## **1. 1<sup>st</sup>.** **Hydrolysis**

⑴ Hydrolysis **:** Protein dissolves into amino acids

⑵ Example **:** In case muscle protein breaks down during starvation.

<br>

<br>

## 2. 2<sup>nd</sup>. **Ornithin cycle**

⑴ Reaction place **:** **Liver**

⑵ Reaction **:** Alanin becomes α-keto acid which is non-amino acid through deamination.

⑶ Example of α-keto acid

> ① Glutamic acid **:** Becomes α-keto glutaric acid.

> ② Alanin **:** Becomes pyruvate.

> ③ Aspartic acid **:** Becomes oxaloacetic acid.

> ④ Leucine, lysine **:** Becomes acetyl coA.

<br>

<br>

## **3. 3<sup>rd</sup>. Metabolism of α-keto acid**

⑴ Non-acetyl coA **:** Participates TCA cycle.

⑵ Acetyl coA

> ① If the protein breaks down, he or she must be starved.

> ② Oxaloacetic acid in the body is already used for gluconeogenesis for the brain.

> ③ Since the amount of acetyl coA is large and is not actively used in the TCA cycle, ketone bodies appear.

>> ○ Ketone body **:** Acetoacetic acid, D-β-hydroxybutyric acid, acetone

>> ○ Ketone body is used as an energy source for the heart, kidney, muscle,  and **brain**.
