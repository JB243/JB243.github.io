## **1\. Overview**

 ⑴ Proteins are used as energy when carbohydrates are absent

<br>

<br>

## **2\. 1<sup>st</sup>. Hydrolysis **

⑴ Hydrolysis **:** Proteins are broken down into amino acids

⑵ Example **:** Muscle protein breakdown during starvation

<br>

<br>

## **3\. 2<sup>nd</sup>. Deamination Reaction**

⑴ Overall Reaction **:** α-amino acid + NAD<sup>+</sup> \+ H2O ⇄ α-keto acid + NH4+ \+ NADH + H+

⑵ **2<sup>nd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>.** Action of aminotransferase (transaminase)

> ① α-amino acid + α-ketoglutarate → α-keto acid + glutamate

> ② PLP (pyridoxal phosphate) acts as a coenzyme

 ⑶ **2<sup>nd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>.** Action of glutamate dehydrogenase

> ① Reaction **: **glutamate + NAD+ \+ H2O ⇄ NH4+ \+ α-ketoglutarate + NADH + H+

> ② **Step 2-1.** glutamate + NAD+ → NADH + H+ \+ Schiff base (intermediate)

> ③ **Step 2-2.** Schiff base + H2O → NH4+ \+ α-ketoglutarate

> ④ Note **:** GPT, GOT

 ⑷ Types of Alpha-Keto Acids

> ① Glutamate **:** Becomes α-Ketoglutaric acid

> ② Alanine **:** Becomes pyruvate

> ③ Aspartate **:** Becomes oxaloacetate

> ④ Leucine, Lysine **:** Become acetyl CoA. Only these two amino acids do not lead to **gluconeogenesis from amino acids**

> ⑤ Serine **:** Becomes pyruvate + NH4+

> ⑥ Threonine **:** Becomes α-ketobutyrate + NH4+

## **4\. 3<sup>rd</sup>. [Ornithine Cycle](https://jb243.github.io/pages/87)**

 ⑴ Also known as the glucose-alanine cycle

 **Figure. 1.** Glucose-Alanine Cycle

<Br>

 ⑵ **3<sup>rd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>.** Reaction of pyruvate + NH4+ → alanine occurs in muscle cells, etc.

 ⑶ **3<sup>rd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>.** Alanine travels to the **liver** through the blood

 ⑷ **3<sup>rd</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>.** Alanine → glutamate + pyruvate

> ① glutamate → NH4+ → urea

> ② pyruvate → glucose

<br>

<br>

## **5\. 4<sup>th</sup>. Metabolism of Alpha-Keto Acids **

⑴ Non-acetyl CoA **:** Participates in the TCA cycle

⑵ Acetyl CoA

> ① Indicates a state of starvation if protein is being degraded

> ② Oxaloacetate in the body is already used for gluconeogenesis for the brain

> ③ Busy creating energy, hence no additional gluconeogenesis

> ④ Excess acetyl CoA leads to ketone body formation since it is not actively used in the TCA cycle

>> ○ Ketone bodies **:** Acetoacetic acid, D-β-hydroxybutyric acid, acetone

>> ○ Ketone bodies are used as an energy source for the heart, kidneys, muscles, and brain

>> ○ Excessive ketone body production lowers the pH of the blood
