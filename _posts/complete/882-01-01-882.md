## **1\. Manufacturer**

⑴ Many opt for Dell or HP workstations

⑵ Search for "Dell Precision Tower" or visit the official Dell website

<br>

<br>

## **2. GPU** (graphic processing unit)

⑴ A Series

> ① Feature **:** Specialized in computations

> ② Latest specifications **:** H100, A100, A6000, A5000, etc.

⑵ GeForce

> ① [Official GeForce Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/ko-kr/geforce/drivers/)

> ② Feature **:** Gaming specialization

> ③ Latest specifications **:** GeForce RTX3090, GeForce RTX4090, etc.

⑶ A Series vs GeForce

> ① The difference between A Series and GeForce is not significant when running only deep learning tasks.

> ② Performance metrics

>> ○ Tensor Cores

>> ○ VRAM **:** For instance, A6000 has more VRAM than RTX3090.

> ③ When installing multiple GPUs in parallel, be aware that supported GPUs may be limited due to fan structures, etc.

<br>

<br>

## **3. CPU** (central processing unit)

⑴ Intel vs AMD

> ① Compatibility (Intel) vs Stability (AMD)

> ② Latest specifications **:** AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, etc.

<br>

<br>

## **4. RAM** (random access memory)

⑴ [SRAM vs DRAM](https://jb243.github.io/pages/922#footnote_link_67_55)

⑵ In the field of bioinformatics, using RStudio extensively, 128 GB of RAM is recommended to ensure smooth bioinformatics analysis.

<br>

<br>

## **5. Drive**

⑴ SSD vs HDD

> ① SSDs are fast but expensive, HDDs are slow but cheaper.

>> ○ HDD prices are very low unless using Dell drives (1 million KRW per pentabyte).

> ② This leads to the general practice of using SSDs for computation and HDDs for storage and backup.

> ③ For an 8 million KRW Linux server for bioinformatics, using an SSD of 4 TB and an HDD of 8 TB provides a balanced feeling.

⑵ [Synology NAS](https://jb243.github.io/pages/2247)

⑶ Cloud Services **:** When dealing with large datasets, consider using cloud-based drives over local ones.

> ① Naver Cloud

> ② SK Data Center

> ③ Amazon

> ④ Google

<br>

<br>

## **6. Frame**

⑴ Rack vs Tower

> ① Rack > Tower **:** Rack servers are preferred due to easier management like stacking.

> ② Rack < Tower

>> ○ Building rack servers requires careful noise and heat management.

>> ○ Tower servers usually have better internal heat dissipation.

>> ○ Unless a separate server room with 24/7 air conditioning is available, tower servers are recommended.

<br>

<br>

## **7. Miscellaneous**

⑴ Individual servers (workstations) cost around 8 to 10 million KRW.

⑵ For server setups around 150 million KRW, switch equipment and bandwidth need to be considered.

⑶ Given rising electricity costs, server specs with high energy efficiency are preferred.

⑷ Many second-hand server equipment becomes available towards the end of the year.

> ① In 2016, a server costing 10 million KRW could now be assembled for around 300,000 KRW **:** Comparable to a personal PC.
