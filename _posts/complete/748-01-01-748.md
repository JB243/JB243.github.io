## **1\. Ancient History**

 ⑴ Discovery of Electricity: Induction of Static Electricity in Amber by Friction

 ⑵ Discovery of Magnetism: Phenomenon of Magnetite Attracting Iron Filings

> ① Thales (Magnesia), "Magnetite has a soul and attracts things."

> ② Empedocles, "Magnetic effluvium comes out from iron and is attracted to a magnet."

 ⑶ Equating Electricity and Magnetism (Attraction, Action at a Distance)

<br>

<br>

## **2. Medieval History**

 ⑴ Peregrinus's Model

> ① Magnetic poles point toward the poles

> ② Density of magnetic poles increases as you move from the center toward the poles

> ③ Follows lines connecting from one pole to the other

## **3\. Modern History**

 ⑴ Gilbert: Royal Physician of England

> ① Argued that the Earth is a magnet based on the model of a spherical magnet

> ② Proposed a cosmic model based on magnetic forces

 ⑵ Descartes: Presented models using lodestone

 ⑶ Grey

> ① Classified conductors and insulators through frictional electricity

> ② Classified metals as conductors

 ⑷ Nollet's Electrostatic Experiment

> ① Discovered that charged individuals can attract small grain or paper pieces

> ② Felt a spark and tingling sensation when touching people

 ⑸ Du Fay's Electric Fluid

> ① Discovered two different types of electricity through frictional electricity

> ② Differentiated between resinous electricity and vitreous electricity

> ③ Glass acquires a + charge easily, while materials like silk or Teflon acquire a - charge

 ⑹ Benjamin Franklin: Differentiated electricity not by types but by gaining or losing it

 ⑺ Volta

> ① Discharge happens instantaneously with high voltage, making it unobservable

> ② Voltaic pile enables observation of continuous current at low voltage

 ⑻ Galvani

> ① Observed muscle movement through different metals

> ② Copper becomes (+) pole, zinc becomes (-) pole

 ⑼ Coulomb: Measurement of Electromagnetic Forces

 ⑽ Oersted: Fusion of Electricity and Magnetism

 ⑾ Faraday: Combination of Various Types of Electricity

> ① Argued for sameness from the observation of consistent characteristics across types of electricity

> ② Electromagnetic induction

 ⑿ Maxwell: Integration of Electricity and Magnetism

 ⒀ Hertz

> ① Detection of Electromagnetic Waves

> ② Flames not observed in the vertical direction
