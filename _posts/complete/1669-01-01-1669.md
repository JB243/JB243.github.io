## **1\. Introduction**

 ⑴ _When the hour hand points to the sun, the direction that bisects the hour hand and 12 o'clock is south_

> ① As seen in Scorpion Season 1 and Detective Conan.

 ⑵ Related to the diurnal motion of the celestial sphere

 ⑶ **Example 1.** Sunrise **:** Assuming 6 AM, with the hour hand pointing east, the 9 o'clock direction is south

 ⑷ **Example 2.** Noon **:** 12 PM, with the hour hand pointing south, the 12 o'clock direction is south (cf. solar noon altitude)

 ⑸ **Example 3.** Sunset **:** Assuming 6 PM, with the hour hand pointing west, the 3 o'clock direction is south

<br>

<br>

## **2\. Proof**

 ⑴ Simplification **:** Sunrise at exactly 6:00 AM in the east, sunset at exactly 6:00 PM in the west, the solar path is parallel to the horizontal plane

> ① Part of the solar path is above the horizontal plane, and part is below, hence the concept of day and night

> ② The angle between the solar path and the celestial horizontal plane is 90 - φ° (where φ **:** latitude)

**Figure. 1.** Proof Diagram

<br>

> ① The sun is t° (-90 ≤ t ≤ 90) from the south

> ② ⇔ The current time T is T(t) = 12 + t / 15 (hours)

>> ○ **Reason 1.** (t, T) = (-90, 6), (0, 12), (90, 18) are passed

>> ○ **Reason 2.** T = T(t) forms a straight line graph

> ③ ⇔ The angle between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock direction is 2t°

>> ○ **Reason 1.** For every hour past 12, the angle of the hour hand widens by 30°

>> ○ **Reason 2.** 30 × t / 15 = 2t

> ④ ⇔ The south direction is the direction that bisects the hour hand and 12 o'clock

## **3\. Supplement:** Ways to find directions without a compass

 ⑴ Using an analog watch

 ⑵ Only possible at noon

> ① South **:** Direction of the sun

> ② North **:** Direction of the shadow

> ③ East **:** When facing away from the sun and looking at your shadow, the right direction

> ④ West **:** When facing away from the sun and looking at your shadow, the left direction

 ⑶ Finding directions at night

> ① Direction of the North Star

> ② By coincidence, the North Star is currently in the direction of Earth's axis of rotation

> ③ Due to precession, the North Star may not always be in the direction of the axis
