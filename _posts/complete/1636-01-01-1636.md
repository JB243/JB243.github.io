## **1\. Greenhouse Effect**

 ⑴ Greenhouse Effect 

> ① Atmospheric temperature without greenhouse effect **:** -6 ℃

> ② Atmospheric temperature considering greenhouse effect **:** 15 ℃

> ③ **Category 1.** Natural greenhouse effect

> ④ **Category 2.** Enhanced greenhouse effect

 ⑵ Earth's Energy Balance

> ① 30% of energy from the sun is reflected

> ② 70% of energy from the sun is absorbed

> ③ About 30% of emitted energy from the Earth is absorbed by the atmosphere

 ⑶ History

> ① Jean-Baptiste Fourier (1827) **:** Highlighted the similarity between atmospheric and greenhouse glass effects

> ② John Tyndall (1860) **:** Measured the absorption of infrared radiation by carbon dioxide and water vapor

> ③ Svante Arrhenius (1896) **:** Calculated the effect of greenhouse gas concentrations (5-6 ℃ increase when doubled)

> ④ G. S. Callendar (1940) **:** Estimated the warming effect of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels

> ⑤ Roger Revelle & Hans Suess (1957) **:** Modeled the impact of carbon dioxide, started measurements

 ⑷ Optical Window

> ① Definition **: **Frequency range of light that doesn't interact with the atmosphere

**Figure. 1.** Optical Window [Footnote: 1]

> ② Solar window **:** Frequency range of light that is absorbed by the Earth's surface, not the atmosphere

> ③ Atmospheric window **:** Frequency range of light not absorbed by the atmosphere and emitted outward

 ⑸ Greenhouse Gases

> ① Energy stored through molecular vibration

> ② Energy stored through electron excitation

> ③ Earth's warming potential due to greenhouse gases

> ④ Magnitude of influence **:** Water vapor > Carbon dioxide > ...

> ⑤ Greenhouse effect due to increased carbon dioxide **:** Increases logarithmically

>> ○ Average global temperature with current CO2 levels **:** 15 ℃

>> ○ Average global temperature with CO2 levels doubled from current **:** 15 + 1.2 ℃

>> ○ Feedback **:** 15 + 2.5 ℃

> ⑥ Methane gas, chlorofluorocarbons **:** Interfere with atmospheric window, hinder atmospheric emission

> ⑦ Cloud Effect

>> ○ High clouds **:** Decrease temperature

>> ○ Low clouds **:** Increase temperature

> ⑧ Volcanic Activity **:** Disrupts energy absorption into the Earth's surface ⇔ Decreases temperature

## **2\. Global Warming**

 ⑴ **Issue 1.** Oceans and Greenhouse Effect

> ① El Niño phenomenon (Origin **:** Male Child)

**Figure. 2.** El Niño Phenomenon [Footnote: 2]

140° W corresponds to the central Pacific

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Weakening of trade winds near the equator **:** Temperatures in the western Pacific decrease while temperatures in the eastern Pacific increase

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Central Pacific temperatures higher than normal

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Strengthened convection in the central Pacific

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Increased rainfall in eastern Pacific, decreased rainfall in western Pacific

> ② La Niña phenomenon (Origin **:** Female Child)

**Figure. 3.** La Niña Phenomenon [Footnote: 3]

140° W corresponds to the central Pacific

>> ○ 1<sup>st</sup>. Strengthening of trade winds near the equator

>> ○ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Enhanced flow of ocean currents from the eastern to western Pacific

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Upwelling of cold deep-sea water near the coast of Peru in the eastern Pacific

>> ○ 4<sup>th</sup>. Decreased temperatures of Eastern Pacific, increased temperatures in Western Pacific

>> ○ 5<sup>th</sup>. Increased rainfall in Western Pacific

> ③ Rising temperatures lead to carbon dioxide release from the oceans

 ⑵ **Issue 2.** Glaciers and Greenhouse Effect

> ① Thermal expansion of glaciers and sea levels

>> ○ Around 0 ℃ **:** Minimal change in volume

>> ○ Around 5 ℃ **:** 1/10,000 change per 1 ℃

>> ○ Around 25 ℃ **:** 3/10,000 change per 1 ℃

>> ○ About 3 cm change per 100 m depth

>> ○ Estimated rise of about 50 cm by the end of the 21st century

>> ○ Sea level rise effect **:** Antarctic > Greenland > Continental glaciers

> ② Global climate change due to glacier variations

>> ○ Melting ice poses risk of glacier collapse

 ⑶ **Issue 3.** Ozone Hole

> ① Ozone hole appears primarily in the Antarctic stratosphere during September to October, the beginning of spring in Antarctica

> ② Role of chlorofluorocarbons

 ⑷ **Issue 4.** Desertification

> ① Climate changes like global warming can contribute to desertification

> ② Expansion of deserts leads to increased surface reflectivity

 ⑸ Other Phenomena

> ① Decreased heating demand

> ② Positive Effects **:** Increased plant productivity

> ③ Cultivation of tropical fruits

> ④ Irregular rainfall **:** Efforts to address through reservoirs like Cheonghodae

> ⑤ Increased mosquitoes and tropical diseases **:** Need for disease control

> ⑥ Increased electricity demand in summer **:** Need for alternative energy generation

 ⑹ Evidence for Global Warming

> ① Analysis of past Earth temperatures **:** Ice cores

> ② Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in Hawaii

**Figure. 4.** Hourly atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration measurements at Mauna Loa

 ⑺ Counterarguments to Global Warming

> ① Assertion of exaggerated results by IPCC

> ② Milankovitch theory **:** Axial tilt, precession, distance from the sun, sunspots, etc.

> ③ Assertion of cyclic nature of global temperature change

> ④ Claim that human contribution to global warming is smaller than natural effects like ocean and volcanic activity

 ⑻ History of Climate Change Agreements

> ① 1972 **:** Discussions on environmental limits (United Nations Conference on the Human Environment)

> ② 1977 **:** Discovery of desertification progress

> ③ 1985 **:** Discovery of the ozone hole

>> ○ "Large losses of total ozone in Antarctica reveal seasonal ClOx/NOx interaction" (1985. 05. 16)

>>> ○ J. C. Farman, B. G. Gardiner, J. D. Shanklin

>>> ○ Discovered in a small British research station

>>> ○ Hesitated to publish their results for 5 years due to self-doubt

>> ○ "Nimbus 7 satellite measurements of the springtime Antarctic ozone decrease"

>>> ○ R. S. Stolarski, A. J. Krueger, M. R. Schoeberl, R. D. McPeters, P. A. Newman, J. C. Alpert (1986. 08. 28)

>>> ○ NASA validated the preceding British research

>>> ○ Failed to identify major flaws in meteorological data processing algorithms due to authoritarian biases

> ④ 1992 **:** Rio Agreement for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and forest protection

>> ○ Official title **:** United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

> ⑤ 1997 **:** Kyoto Protocol with emission reduction targets until 2012

>> ○ Kyoto Protocol **:** Amendment to the Rio Agreement

>> ○ Resolved to reduce emissions by 5% until 2012

>> ○ Not fully implemented, including the US withdrawal

> ⑥ 2009 **:** Copenhagen Accord with recommendations

> ⑦ 2015 **:** Carbon emission trading system

>> ○ Introduced in the EU in 2015

>> ○ Carbon emission rights **:** Rights to emit greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc.)

>> ○ Issues with the system

>>> ○ Economic downturn due to costs of industrial activity

>>> ○ Decreased value of emission rights due to economic fluctuations

>>> ○ Difficulty in achieving effects beyond a certain reduction threshold

 ⑼ Current Status

> ① Carbon dioxide emissions from residential heating account for 1/5 of emissions from power facilities
