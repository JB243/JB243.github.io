## **Step 1** **:** ethanol → acetaldehyde

⑴ **1-1.** ADH-mediated reaction

> ① ADH **:** alcohol dehydrogenase

> ② Ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde by ADH in the liver, simultaneously reducing NAD+ to NADH

> ③ All people have no difficulty performing this reaction

⑵ **1-2.** MEOS-mediated reaction

> ① MEOS **:** microsomal ethanol oxidizing system

> ② Ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde by MEOS in the liver, simultaneously converting NADPH to NADP + O2

> ③ When a large amount of alcohol enters the body, the liver secretes protective enzymes for the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system

> ③ When a large amount of alcohol enters the body, the liver secretes protective enzymes for the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)

>> ○ This induces a reaction that increases the number of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) in liver cells, thereby breaking down ethanol more quickly

>> ○ Practically, it is possible to increase alcohol tolerance

>> ○ This explanation provides evidence that alcohol tolerance is acquired

## **Step 2** **:** acetaldehyde → acetate

⑴ ALDH-mediated reaction

> ① ALDH **:** aldehyde dehydrogenase

> ② Acetaldehyde is converted to acetate by ALDH in the liver

> ③ Some people have mutations in the genes involved in performing this reaction

>> ○ Such mutations are mainly observed in Asians

>> ○ Incomplete dominance **:** If homozygous, this reaction hardly proceeds, but if heterozygous, this reaction proceeds to some extent

>> ○ Because acetaldehyde is highly toxic, it causes liver damage, including hangovers

>> ○ If ALDH is low, hangovers are so severe that there is an aversion to alcohol: as a result, there will be fewer cases of alcoholism

>> ○ This explanation provides evidence that alcohol tolerance is somewhat genetic

## **Step 3 :** Hangover Relief

⑴ Hangover relief from bean sprouts **:** Asparagine, abundantly present in bean sprouts, can chelate acetaldehyde
