## **1\. Overview**

⑴ Lipids are used as energy when carbohydrates are not available

<br>

<br>

## **2\. In Animal Cells**

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Adipocytes

> ① 1<sup>st</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Hormones bind to receptors, generating cAMP

> ② 1<sup>st</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. cAMP activates PKA, which activates perilipin A and lipase

> ③ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Perilipin A is phosphorylated and changes to a structure that makes fat easier to break down

> ④ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 4<sup>th</sup>. Various lipases break down triacylglycerol into glycerol and fatty acids

> ⑤ 1<sup>st</sup> \- 5<sup>th</sup>. Fatty acids are released from cells and travel via serum albumin

⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Plasma **:** Glycerol and fatty acids travel through the plasma

⑶ 3<sup>rd</sup>. Skeletal Muscle Cells

> ① Glycerol **:** Rarely used in glycolysis in skeletal muscle cells

> ② Fatty Acids

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. As a result of [Beta Oxidation](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1420), fatty acid is converted to Acetyl-CoA

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. After the [Acyl-Carnitine Cycle](https://jb243.github.io/pages/1420), Acetyl-CoA passes directly through the mitochondrial inner membrane

>> ○ 3<sup>rd</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Acetyl-CoA is broken down into CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O through the TCA cycle

⑷ 4<sup>th</sup>. Liver Cells

> ① Glycerol **:** Converted to G3P and immediately participates in glycolysis

> ② Fatty Acids

>> ○ Situation **:** Significant fasting state is implied for fatty acids to be broken down, oxaloacetic acid in the body is used for gluconeogenesis in the brain

>> ○ There is a lot of Acetyl-CoA, which is not used in the TCA cycle or gluconeogenesis, so keton body reaction occurs

>> ○ Ketone Body **:** Acetoacetate, D-β-Hydroxybutyrate, Acetone

>> ○ Ketone bodies are used as an energy source by the heart, kidneys, muscles, and brain

## **3\. Animal Cells:** Terminal Oxidation and Subterminal Oxidation

⑴ Terminal oxidation and subterminal oxidation occur when alkanes are broken down

## **4\. Animal Cells:** Beta Oxidation (β oxidation)

⑴ Location

> ① Animal Cells **:** 1/3 in peroxisomes, 2/3 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space

> ② Plant Cells **:** 100% in peroxisomes

> ③ Note that fatty acid tail synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm and lipid synthesis in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum

⑵ Reaction

**Figure 3.** Beta Oxidation Reaction Cycle

<br>

> ① Only saturated fatty acids undergo beta oxidation

> ② During the reaction, 1 FADH2 is first produced ( **1st oxidation** ), followed by 1 NADH ( **2nd oxidation** )

> ③ As a result of one beta oxidation cycle, one Acetyl-CoA (2C) is produced from the fatty acid.

> ④ Fatty acids with 2n carbons undergo n-1 beta oxidation cycles, producing n-1 Acetyl-CoA and 1 glycerol

 ⑶ Application **:** Palmitic acid, a C16 saturated fatty acid, is converted to palmitoyl-CoA and generates 8 molecules of Acetyl-CoA through β oxidation

## **5\. Animal Cells:** Acyl-Carnitine Cycle

⑴ 1<sup>st</sup>. Acetyl-CoA is produced from pyruvate in the mitochondrial matrix

> ① Saturated Fatty Acids

>> ○ The acyl coA synthetase on the **mitochondrial outer membrane** removes ppi from ATP and attaches coA to the fatty acid to form acyl-coA

>> ○ ppi is broken down into 2pi by pyrophosphatase

>> ○ Carnitine acyltransferase 1 on the outer membrane replaces coA with carnitine

>> ○ Acyl carnitine is transported by translocase on the inner membrane

>> ○ Acyl carnitine is converted to acyl coA by carnitine acyltransferase 2 on the inner membrane

>> ○ Acyl coA → trans-Δ2 enoyl coA → L-3-hydroxyacyl coA (enzyme **:** acyl coA dehydrogenase)

>> ○ L-3-hydroxyacyl coA → 3-ketoacyl coA (enzyme **:** L-3-hydroxylacl coA dehydrogenase)

>> ○ 3-ketoacyl coA → acyl coA (n-2) + **acetyl coA** (enzyme **:** β-ketothiolase)

> ② Unsaturated Fatty Acids

>> ○ Additional involvement of isomerase and reductase, producing propionyl coA and succinyl coA

>> ○ Propionyl coA (3C) + HCO3- → methylmalonyl coA (4C) (enzyme **:** propionyl coA carboxylase)

>> ○ Methylmalonyl coA (4C) → succinyl coA (enzyme **:** mutase)

 ⑵ 2<sup>nd</sup>. Acyl-Carnitine Cycle **:** Acetyl-CoA cannot pass through the mitochondrial inner membrane

> ① 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 1<sup>st</sup>. Acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetic acid → citric acid

> ② 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 2<sup>nd</sup>. Citric acid can directly pass through the mitochondrial inner membrane

> ③ 2<sup>nd</sup> \- 3<sup>rd</sup>. Citric acid that has passed through the mitochondrial inner membrane is broken down into oxaloacetic acid and Acetyl-CoA

<br>

<br>

## **6\. In Plant Cells**

⑴ Glyoxysome **:** Exists only in plants

> ① Glyoxysome does not contain succinate dehydrogenase

⑵ Glyoxylate Cycle

> ① Overview

>> ○ Converts fatty acids into glucose

>> ○ Occurs across lipid bodies, glyoxysomes, and mitochondria

> ② **Reaction 1.** Acetyl coA is produced by beta oxidation of fatty acids

>> ○ Since beta oxidation produces H2O2, glyoxysomes also contain catalase

> ③ **Reaction 2.** Acetyl coA + OAA → citrate

> ④ **Reaction 3.** Citrate → succinate + glyoxylate

>> ○ Succinate moves to mitochondria and reacts to malate in the TCA cycle

> ⑤ **Reaction 4.** Glyoxylate + Acetyl coA → malate

> ⑥ **Reaction 5.** Malate → OAA

> ⑦ **Reaction 6.** OAA is converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis in the cytoplasm

 ⑶ Lipids stored in seeds are an energy source until the young plant can photosynthesize

> ① During early stages, photosynthesis is not performed, so glyoxysomes convert fatty acids into sugar

⑷ Animal cells cannot perform gluconeogenesis from fatty acids
